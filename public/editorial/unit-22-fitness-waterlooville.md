## More Than a Gym

CrossFit gets a reputation for being intimidating. Unit 22 Fitness flips that script. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, the coaching meets you where you are.

The community aspect makes the difference. When everyone's cheering you on, those last few reps feel a little less impossible.

## Functional Fitness That Works

Forget the machines. Unit 22 focuses on functional movements — the kind that translate to real life. Lifting, pulling, pushing, squatting. Movements your body was designed to do.

The result? Strength that actually makes your daily life easier.
