# 'I'm Lifting Weights I Never Thought Possible.' Jack Williamson PT Is Transforming Slough, One Client at a Time.

**32 five-star reviews. A private gym in his back garden. Jack Williamson is the personal trainer Slough can't stop talking about.**

Finding a personal trainer is easy. Finding one who actually gets results? That's the hard part.

Jack Williamson runs a private gym from his home near Tempest Avenue in Slough. No crowded gym floors. No waiting for equipment. No intimidation factor. Just you, Jack, and a space built for one thing: getting you fitter.

And his clients are noticing the difference.

The results speak for themselves:
