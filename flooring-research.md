## CHALLENGE REPORT

After extensive searching (Google Maps searches for Slough, Cowplain, Horndean, Denmead, Portsmouth areas), finding 10 flooring specialists that meet ALL three criteria proved extremely difficult:

**Key Findings:**
- Most established flooring businesses use landline numbers (023 numbers)
- Many independent mobile contractors have fewer than 5 reviews
- The flooring industry in this area is dominated by shops/showrooms rather than mobile-only operators

**Businesses with landlines but good reviews (not meeting mobile criteria):**
- Arbor The Flooring Company - 023 9311 8464 - 5.0★ (18)
- Palmer Flooring Contractors - 023 9300 1057 - 5.0★ (23)
- Tapi Carpets & Floors - 023 9421 8230 - 4.2★ (46)
- Victory Carpets - 023 9226 6699 - 4.1★ (29)
- Topps Tiles - 023 9226 1900 - 5.0★ (315)
