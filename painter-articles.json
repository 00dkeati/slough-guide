We have used her 4 times now, for different houses and have already booked her in for January 2026 as we have had a massive leak from our roof and the water staining is vast.  She uses specialist treatments and paints for water damaged areas. She is polite, efficient and always leaves the workspace clean and tidy between coats. She always turned up on time and I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending her to anyone!",

The cupboard doors were removed and taken away to their studio to be  stripped and spray painted. This gave them a finish to make them look brand new and the carcasses were painted to the same standard. The worktops were sanded, the ceiling and walls were prepped and painted, so the end result is very impressive. On top of all that they are thoroughly nice guys to work with and we will certainly employ them again in the future! The team is led by David, who is fanatical about attention to detail, materials, and tools which I guess comes from his degree in architectural modelling. 🤩",

All the materials used in our installation including all the units, shower pump, vanity mirror, tiling and flooring are all of very high quality.
