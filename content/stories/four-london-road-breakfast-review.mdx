# We Tried Breakfast at Four London Road – Here's the Verdict

**Location:** 4 London Road, Horndean, PO8 0BZ  
**Visited:** January 2026  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We've walked past Four London Road countless times, usually popping in for dinner or drinks. But breakfast? That was new territory. So on a Friday morning, we decided to find out what the brunch hype was all about.

**Spoiler: we were impressed.**

## What We Ordered

### The Waffles with Parma Ham (£12)

Golden, fluffy waffles topped with crispy parma ham and perfectly cooked hash browns. The microgreens added a fresh touch, and the whole thing came together beautifully. Sweet meets savoury done right.

**Verdict:** Proper brunch food. Instagram-worthy but genuinely delicious too.

### The Steak Wrap (£14)

Skirt steak, scrambled eggs, and sriracha mayo sauce wrapped up and served on a bed of fresh rocket. This is a *big* wrap – seriously generous portion. The steak was tender, the eggs creamy, and that sriracha mayo gave it a proper kick.

**Verdict:** If you're hungry, this is the one. Filling, flavourful, excellent value for £14.

## The Experience

**Portion sizes:** Really good. You won't leave hungry.

**Service:** Great – friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

**Vibe:** Relaxed. It was quiet when we visited (no background music this time, though they usually have it), which made for a chilled breakfast catch-up.

**The menu:** Loads of options – from the signature Four London Road Benedict (£10) to Halloumi Wraps (£11), Breakfast Patatas Bravas (£11), and lighter options like Granola (£8.50). Something for everyone.

## Would We Go Back?

**Absolutely.** This was our first time trying breakfast here and we were genuinely impressed. The food quality matches what you'd expect from Four London Road's dinner service, and the brunch menu has some creative options you won't find elsewhere locally.

If you're looking for somewhere beyond the usual greasy spoon for a weekend breakfast or weekday brunch, Four London Road delivers.
