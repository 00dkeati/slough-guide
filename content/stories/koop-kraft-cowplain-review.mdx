Koop+Kraft is a stylish bar-restaurant on Cowplain's London Road. With its brass table lamps, wooden tables and moody lighting, it looks more cocktail bar than traditional pub.

We visited on a Sunday afternoon to try their roast. The venue impressed — the food less so.

## The venue

The interior is dark and cosy, the kind of place that looks better in the evening than it would at noon. Despite the bar-restaurant vibe, it works for families. On our visit there was a good mix of couples and families with children.

We called at 4:15pm and got a table for 4:45pm. Getting a Sunday roast booking at half an hour's notice is impressive — most places would turn you away.

There's no on-site parking. The public car park behind the venue (by Domino's) costs £1.20 per hour via the Ringo app.

## The food

*The beef roast came with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, stuffing and seasonal vegetables*

We ordered the lamb and beef roasts (£13 each). Both arrived on dark rustic plates with a Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, stuffing ball, cauliflower cheese and seasonal vegetables. Gravy came in a small pot on the side.

The roast potatoes were properly crispy. The stuffing was tasty. The gravy had good flavour. The lamb was decent — the better of the two meats.

But the beef was chewy and tasteless. The Yorkshire pudding was also chewy rather than light and fluffy. The vegetables — parsnips and carrots — were too al dente and needed more cooking time.

*The lamb roast fared better than the beef*

At £13 per roast, the price is fair. The problem isn't value — it's inconsistent execution. Some elements hit the mark, others miss it.

## Kids meals

*The kids burger was a hit*

From the "Kooper Trooper" kids menu (£6 each), we ordered a cheeseburger and mac & cheese, both with chips.

The burger was a success. Our fussiest eater finished the whole thing — a proper patty in a brioche bun, not a frozen afterthought.

The mac & cheese was bland. Our other child wasn't keen, and having tried it ourselves we understood why. It needed seasoning.

*The mac and cheese lacked flavour*

The chips were heavily seasoned with herbs and spices — not just salt. Some children would love them. Ours found them too much. Worth asking if your kids prefer plain chips.

## The bill

A family of four with drinks came to £48.95:

- Lamb roast: £13
- Beef roast: £13
- Kids cheeseburger and chips: £6
- Kids mac and cheese and chips: £6
- Coca Cola: £3.95
- Appletiser: £3.50
- Orange juice: £3.50

Just under £50 is reasonable for a family Sunday lunch. The value isn't the issue.

## Verdict

Koop+Kraft is a good-looking venue with genuine atmosphere. It works for families without feeling like a soft play centre, and the cocktail bar vibe is appealing for evening visits.

But the Sunday roast is average. The roast potatoes, stuffing and gravy deliver, but the meat and Yorkshire pudding let it down. For £13 you can find better roasts elsewhere.

**Come here for:** drinks, evening meals, burgers, the atmosphere

**Go elsewhere for:** a proper Sunday roast
