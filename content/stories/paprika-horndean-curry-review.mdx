# Paprika Horndean: We Ordered the Full Spread – Here's the Verdict

**Location:** 9 Horndean Precinct, Portsmouth Road, Horndean, PO8 9LA  
**Visited:** February 2026  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

There's something about a Tuesday night curry that just hits different. No fancy occasion, no excuse needed – just you, a stack of foil containers, and the promise of garlic naan. So when the craving struck, we turned to Paprika, the long-standing Indian restaurant in Horndean that's been feeding locals for over two decades.

**The damage? £33.71 delivered. Worth it? Let's find out.**

## What We Ordered

### Chicken Biryani (£9.95)

The star of the show. Golden, fragrant pilau rice loaded with tender chicken pieces, fresh herbs, and just the right amount of spice. The grains were perfectly separated – none of that stodgy, clumped-together nonsense. This is proper biryani done right.

**Verdict:** The rice alone is worth ordering from Paprika. Fluffy, flavourful, generous portions. 10/10.

### Chicken Tikka Masala (£9.95)

A classic for a reason. The sauce was rich and creamy with a decent depth of flavour. Our only gripe? The chicken was slightly on the dry side – like it had been hitting the gym a bit too hard before ending up in the masala. Still tasty, but could've been more succulent.

**Verdict:** Good, not exceptional. The sauce carries it.

### Prawn Puri (£4.15)

Crispy, puffy puri bread with a generous portion of spiced prawns on top. A solid starter that set the tone for the meal. The prawns were well-seasoned and the puri had that satisfying crunch.

**Verdict:** Great way to kick things off.

### Sag Aloo (£4.50)

Spinach and potato – simple but done well. The spicing was spot-on, earthy and warming. Proper comfort food that paired beautifully with everything else on the plate.

**Verdict:** Reliable side dish. No complaints.

### Garlic Naan (£3.95)

Here's where things dipped slightly. The naan was decent but could've used another minute in the tandoor. A bit pale, a bit doughy in places. It did the job for sauce-mopping, but we've had better.

**Verdict:** Functional rather than fantastic.

### Poppadoms & Mango Chutney (£4.95)

Four crispy poppadoms with that gorgeous sweet mango chutney. The chutney was genuinely excellent – the kind you want to eat with a spoon when no one's looking.

**Verdict:** Chutney perfection. Would order extra next time.

## The Experience

**Portion sizes:** Generous. Two of us ate well and had leftovers.

**Delivery:** Arrived hot, well-packaged in brown paper bags. Free delivery was a nice touch.

**Value:** With the 10% online discount, £33.71 for this spread feels fair. Not the cheapest curry in town, but the quality justifies it.

**Ordering:** Through their website via Ordere – simple and straightforward.

## Would We Order Again?

**Yes.** Paprika delivers a solid, honest curry night. The biryani was exceptional, the sides were reliable, and the mango chutney was a genuine highlight. The slightly dry chicken and underdone naan keep it from five-star territory, but this is still one of the better Indian options in the Horndean area.

If you're after a Tuesday night curry fix (or any night, really), Paprika won't let you down.
