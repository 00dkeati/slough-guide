**Status:** FIRST DRAFT — Ready for review
**Visit date:** Sunday 1 February 2026

## The Bottom Line

Koop+Kraft is a stylish bar-restaurant on Cowplain's London Road with great atmosphere and a family-friendly vibe. But if you're coming specifically for the Sunday roast, manage your expectations — it's average at best.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Good for:** Evening drinks, burgers, date night, cocktails
**Not their strength:** Sunday roast

## The Venue

![Table setting at Koop+Kraft](/images/stories/koop-kraft/table-setting.jpg)
*Brass lamps and wooden tables create a cosy atmosphere*

Koop+Kraft sits at 45-47 London Road in Cowplain. Inside, it's all brass table lamps, wooden tables, and moody lighting — the kind of place that looks better in the evening than it would at noon.

The vibe is more cocktail bar than traditional pub, but don't let that put you off bringing kids. On our Sunday visit, there was a good mix of families and couples. It didn't feel awkward having children there at all.

**Parking:** There's none on-site. Use the public car park behind the venue (by Domino's). It's £1.20/hour and you'll need the Ringo app.

## Booking

We called at 4:15pm on a Sunday and got a table for 4:45pm. Half an hour's notice for a Sunday roast booking is impressive — most places would laugh you off the phone.

## The Food

### Sunday Roasts (£13 each)

*The beef roast — presentation was good, execution less so*

We ordered lamb and beef. Both came on dark rustic plates with a Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, stuffing ball, cauliflower cheese, and seasonal veg. Gravy arrives in a small pot on the side.

**What worked:**
- Roast potatoes — properly crispy
- Stuffing — tasty
- Gravy — good flavour
- Lamb — decent (the better of the two meats)

**What didn't:**
- Beef — chewy and tasteless
- Yorkshire pudding — also chewy, not light and fluffy
- Vegetables (parsnips, carrots) — too al dente, needed more time

*The lamb roast fared better than the beef*

At £13 per roast, the price is fair. The problem isn't value — it's inconsistent execution. Some elements are spot on, others miss the mark.

### Kids Menu — "Kooper Trooper" (£6 each)

*The kids burger was a hit with our fussy eater*

We ordered a cheeseburger (no cheese — fussy child) and mac & cheese, both with chips.

**The burger:** Our fussiest eater finished the whole thing. That's a win. Proper patty in a brioche bun, not a frozen afterthought.

**The mac & cheese:** Bland. Our other child wasn't keen, and having tried it ourselves, we understood why. Needed seasoning.

*Mac and cheese lacked flavour*

**The chips:** Heavily seasoned — herbs and spices, not just salt. Some kids would love them. Ours found them too much. If your kids like flavoured chips, they'll be happy. If they prefer plain, ask.

## The Bill

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Lamb Roast | £13.00 |
| Beef Roast | £13.00 |
| Kids Cheeseburger + Chips | £6.00 |
| Kids Mac & Cheese + Chips | £6.00 |
| Coca Cola | £3.95 |
| Appletiser | £3.50 |
| Orange Juice | £3.50 |
| **Total** | **£48.95** |

Just under £50 for a family of four with drinks. That's reasonable — not cheap, not expensive. The value isn't the issue here.

---

## Service

We waited around 25-30 minutes for food after ordering, which is acceptable for a Sunday roast.

Staff were friendly. Our server was Maddie.

---

## The Verdict

Koop+Kraft is a good-looking venue with genuine atmosphere. It works for families without feeling like a soft play centre, and the evening cocktail bar vibe is appealing.

But the Sunday roast? It's average. The roast potatoes, stuffing and gravy deliver, but the meat and Yorkshire pudding let it down. For £13 you can do better elsewhere.

**Come here for:** Drinks, evening meals, burgers, the atmosphere
**Go elsewhere for:** A proper Sunday roast
