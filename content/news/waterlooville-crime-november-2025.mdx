The latest crime figures from Hampshire Police reveal 158 incidents were recorded across Waterlooville during November 2025. While the numbers may seem high at first glance, they paint a picture largely consistent with previous months — and with similar towns across Hampshire.

We've analysed the data to break down exactly what's happening in our community.

## Violent Crime Tops the List

The largest category was violent crime, accounting for 65 of the 158 total incidents. This includes everything from common assault to more serious offences.

It's worth noting that "violent crime" in police statistics covers a broad range of incidents, including verbal threats and minor altercations that don't result in injury. The category can appear inflated compared to what most residents would consider violence.

Most incidents occurred in the town centre, particularly around the Wellington Way area and near late-night venues.

## Shoplifting Remains a Persistent Issue

Twenty-one shoplifting incidents were recorded — a figure that will come as no surprise to local retailers who have long raised concerns about theft from shops along the high street.

The figure represents a slight increase on October's numbers, though it remains within the typical range for the area.

## Anti-Social Behaviour Concentrated on Weekends

Nineteen reports of anti-social behaviour were logged during November, with the majority occurring on Friday and Saturday evenings.

The pattern is consistent with previous months, with most incidents reported between 9pm and midnight in areas around the town centre and local parks.

## The Good News: Property Crime Stays Low

For homeowners, there's reassuring news in the figures. Only two burglaries were recorded across the entire area during November — a notably low figure that continues a downward trend seen throughout 2025.

Vehicle crime was also minimal, with just one incident reported.

## How Waterlooville Compares

When compared to neighbouring areas like Havant, Horndean, and Cowplain, Waterlooville's figures are broadly similar. The town is neither a hotspot nor notably safer than comparable Hampshire communities.

| Area | Total Incidents (Nov 2025) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Waterlooville | 158 |
| Havant | 172 |
| Horndean | 43 |
| Cowplain | 67 |
