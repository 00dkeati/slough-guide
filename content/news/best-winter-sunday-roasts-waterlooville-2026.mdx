## 1. Bird in Hand, Lovedean

![The Bird in Hand pub](/images/news/sunday-roast/bird-in-hand.jpg)

**Rating:** 4.3 stars (873 reviews) | **Price:** £15-25 | **Booking:** Recommended

The Bird in Hand consistently tops local rankings. Tucked away in Lovedean with a beer garden and traditional country pub atmosphere, it's built a loyal following — even under new management who took over in early 2025.

> "We came in for a Sunday roast, which was amazing as always, staff very friendly"
> — Quandoo review

**Good to know:** Stops serving at 7pm on Sundays. Book ahead.

## 2. The Centurion, Waterlooville

![The Centurion](/images/news/sunday-roast/the-centurion.jpg)

**Rating:** 5.0 stars (66 reviews) | **Price:** £12-18 | **Booking:** Walk-ins OK

Don't let the smaller review count fool you — The Centurion gets consistently glowing feedback. It's also the best value on our list.

> "Came for Sunday lunch, roast was good — we had roast pork and turkey, big portions and homely cooked quality"
> — TripAdvisor review

**Good to know:** The £12 roast is hard to beat locally.

## 3. The Bat and Ball, Hambledon

![The Bat and Ball](/images/news/sunday-roast/bat-and-ball.jpg)

**Rating:** 4.2 stars (754 reviews) | **Price:** £12-20 | **Booking:** Recommended weekends

Worth the short drive from Waterlooville. This historic pub overlooks farmland near the birthplace of cricket — people come for the views as much as the food.

> "Very very nice roast dinner, highly recommend. Nice views out over farmland and A1 food"
> — Tom P

**Good to know:** Great for a countryside escape without going far.

## 4. The George Inn, Finchdean

**Rating:** 4.1 stars (341 reviews) | **Price:** £19-26 | **Booking:** Essential

The premium option. If you want a special occasion Sunday lunch rather than a casual pub roast, this is your pick.

> "We all had the best Sunday Lunch EVER. All the food was cooked to perfection, with beautifully cooked vegetables"
> — Nicola G

**Good to know:** Higher prices, but reviewers say it's worth it for the quality.

The best option in Waterlooville town centre. Number 73 on London Road suits families and couples, with a relaxed vibe and consistently praised roasts.
