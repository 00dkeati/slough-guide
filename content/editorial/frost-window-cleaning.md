## Professional Window Cleaning with a Perfect Track Record

FROST Maintenance & Window Cleaning has established itself as one of Slough's most trusted window cleaning services, boasting an impeccable 10 out of 10 rating on Checkatrade - a testament to their unwavering commitment to quality.

Operating throughout Slough, Havant, Portsmouth, and surrounding areas, this small but experienced team specialises in both residential and commercial exterior cleaning. What sets FROST apart is their comprehensive approach: unlike many competitors, they clean frames, sills, and doors as standard, ensuring customers receive complete value for money.

The company's confidence in their work is reflected in their 48-hour guarantee. If clients aren't satisfied with the service, FROST will return and re-clean free of charge within two days - though they proudly note this has never been necessary.

Fully insured with public liability cover up to £5 million and equipped with pure water systems alongside traditional cleaning methods, FROST handles properties of all types. Their text reminder service keeps customers informed the day before each visit, demonstrating the professional communication standards that have earned them such strong reviews.

"Our Window Cleaners are fully trained to use all equipment needed for all cleaning works undertaken," the company states, highlighting their dedication to both safety and quality standards.

Beyond windows, FROST offers gutter cleaning, conservatory roof cleaning, solar panel maintenance, and full exterior cleaning services, making them a comprehensive solution for property maintenance in the Slough area. Their consistent reliability has made them the go-to choice for homeowners seeking a window cleaner they can trust long-term.
