There's a difference between a photograph that shows what you look like and one that captures how you feel. Ania at Ania Photo specialises in the latter.

From her purpose-built studio in Denmead, she's built a following of over 2,500 on Facebook with her distinctive artistic style that makes every session feel personal and meaningful.

## More Than Surface Deep

Ania describes her philosophy simply: 'My job is to do more than take a photograph of what you look like. My style is relaxed, artistic, and bespoke. I aim to photograph how you're feeling in the moment.'

'Like when you are holding your new baby so close in your arms you can hear their heartbeat next to yours. To belly-laughs with your children. This is life and the moments we want to hold on to.'
