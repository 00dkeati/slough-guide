Danielle took the time to listen to what I wanted and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the entire appointment. I left feeling confident and very happy with the results. Highly recommend!"

**Kalotec Ltd** left a 5-star review:

> "I absolutely love visiting Summer & Co. – it’s always such a treat! Gemma is so lovely and instantly puts me at ease. She really listens to what I want, gives thoughtful advice on styles that will suit me, and her talent always shines through in the results.

It’s more than just a haircut – spending time in the salon feels like therapy. You can relax, get things off your chest, and have a good giggle at the same time. I always leave feeling lighter, happier, and with hair I absolutely love. Couldn’t recommend Gemma and the team enough!"
