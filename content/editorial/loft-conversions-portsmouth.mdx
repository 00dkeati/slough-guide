## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a loft conversion cost in Portsmouth?
A loft conversion in Portsmouth costs between **£25,000 and £100,000+** in 2026. Most homeowners pay £40,000-£70,000 for a rear dormer with bedroom and en-suite. Expect around **£2,400+ per square metre**.

### How long does a loft conversion take in Portsmouth?
A typical Portsmouth loft conversion takes **6-8 weeks**. Victorian terraces may take slightly longer due to party wall requirements.

### Do I need planning permission for a loft conversion in Portsmouth?
**Usually not.** Most conversions fall under Permitted Development. You'll need planning permission in conservation areas (parts of Old Portsmouth and Southsea) or for listed buildings.

### Will a loft conversion add value to my Portsmouth home?
Yes. Loft conversions add **15-20% to property value**. On an average Portsmouth home (£300,000), that's £45,000-£60,000 — well above conversion costs.

### What's the best loft conversion for a Portsmouth terrace?
For Victorian/Edwardian terraces common in Southsea, Milton, and Fratton, a **rear dormer or mansard** works best. Both maximise space while usually avoiding planning permission.

### Can all Portsmouth houses have a loft conversion?
Most can if there's **2.2m headroom** in the existing loft. Some flat-roofed properties or very small lofts may not be suitable. Companies offer free surveys to assess.

### What is the 10 year rule for loft conversions?
The **10-year rule** means unauthorised loft conversions become immune from council enforcement after 10 years (changed from 4 years in April 2024). This only covers planning permission — Building Regulations can always be enforced. Get proper approvals to avoid issues when selling.

### Which lofts cannot be converted?
Lofts can't easily be converted if they have **under 2.2m headroom**, **trussed roofs** (W-shaped, common in 1960s+ homes), or are in **listed buildings**. However, dormer or mansard conversions can add height to otherwise unsuitable lofts.
