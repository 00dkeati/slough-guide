There comes a point every spring where you look out the back window and think: "Right, something needs to happen here." The lawn's a jungle, the borders have gone feral, and that patio hasn't seen a pressure washer in years.

**All Round Property Services** are a landscaping outfit serving Slough and the surrounding Hampshire area who specialise in turning that "something needs to happen" moment into actual results.

## What They Do

The clue's in the name — they cover the lot. Garden clearances for those spaces that have got away from you. Fencing for when the neighbours have had enough of the view. Patios, decking, turfing — the full range of outdoor work that turns a tired garden into something you actually want to use.

It's the kind of practical, roll-your-sleeves-up work that makes a genuine difference to how you use your home.

## Why Go Local

Garden work isn't like ordering something online. You need someone who'll show up, understand what you're after, and actually get it done to a decent standard. Local traders live or die by their reputation — they can't hide behind a corporate brand when the work's not up to scratch.

For Slough residents looking to get their outdoor space sorted, having a local landscaper on call is worth its weight in gold.
