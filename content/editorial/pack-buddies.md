**Contact:** 07494 146965 **Location:** Slough and surrounding areas **Service Type:** Group and individual dog walking

Pack Buddies brings a socialisation-focused approach to dog walking services in Slough, recognising that many dogs benefit significantly from interaction with other animals during exercise sessions. The business name reflects this emphasis on creating compatible "packs" for group walks whilst maintaining appropriate supervision and safety standards.

Group walks typically include three to four dogs of compatible temperaments, sizes, and energy levels. This careful matching process ensures all dogs benefit from the social experience without stress or conflict. Dogs requiring individual attention due to nervousness, age, or specific behavioural considerations can receive solo walks instead.

The business selects walking locations based on the group composition. Confident, energetic dogs enjoy off-lead exercise in secure areas where they can run freely and interact naturally. More cautious animals receive on-lead walks in quieter environments until their confidence develops. This tailored approach prevents overwhelming nervous dogs whilst ensuring energetic breeds receive adequate stimulation.

Slough's access to varied terrain – from urban parks to countryside footpaths – allows Pack Buddies to rotate routes regularly, preventing boredom and providing mental stimulation through new environments. Dogs who walk the same route daily often become disengaged; varying locations maintains their interest and enthusiasm.

The service suits working professionals unable to exercise their dogs during office hours, households with multiple dogs requiring more exercise than owners can provide, and socialisation for dogs who lack interaction opportunities. Regular group walks help develop confident, well-adjusted animals comfortable around other dogs.

For Slough residents seeking dog walking that prioritises both physical exercise and social development, Pack Buddies offers structured group sessions with appropriate safety measures.
