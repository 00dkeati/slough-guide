Let's be honest about Slough's pedestrian precinct: it's not exactly the Champs-Élysées. The shops come and go. The empty units multiply. And yet, tucked away off London Road, down a short alleyway from the pay-and-display, there's a café that's quietly built something approaching a cult following.

Poppins has 309 Google reviews and a 4.4-star rating. For a greasy spoon in a Hampshire market town, that's not just good — it's remarkable.

## Cheap, Cheerful, and Unapologetically Old School

The menu reads like a time capsule. One reviewer called it 'reminiscent of a 1970s Wimpy restaurant' — and meant it as a compliment. This isn't avocado toast territory. This is proper builders' breakfasts, jacket potatoes, and mugs of tea territory.

And the prices? Still firmly in 'won't bankrupt you' zone. You can eat properly without checking your bank balance first.

## What's On the Menu?

Poppins isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. It's doing the classics, and doing them well.

- **Full English breakfast** — The reason most people come
- **Jacket potatoes** — With various fillings
- **Sandwiches** — Hot and cold options
- **Light lunches** — Soup, salads (yes, really)
- **All-day menu** — No awkward 'breakfast ends at 11' rules
- **Tea and coffee** — Builder's strength available

## The Staff Make It

Review after review mentions the same thing: friendly service and fast food (the good kind of fast). Order at your table, pay at the till. No apps. No QR codes. No subscription to a restaurant rewards programme. Just humans being efficient.

## The Verdict

Poppins isn't trying to be Instagram-worthy. It's not competing for foodie awards. It's trying to fill you up with hot food at a fair price, served by people who'll actually smile at you.

In 2026, when every other café wants to be a 'experience' and charges £4.50 for a flat white, that's almost revolutionary.

If you've walked past it a hundred times without noticing, you're not alone. But 309 reviewers reckon it's worth the detour.
