Most photographers work hard to perfect their craft. Lauren Bennett at Lemon Sky Photography has done that – and then taught 35,000 other photographers around the world how to do the same.

From her cosy studio in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, just a short ferry ride from Portsmouth, Lauren has built a multi-award-winning fine art portrait and newborn photography business with nearly 9,000 Facebook followers.

## Why She Stands Out

- **10+ years** as an award-winning portrait & newborn photographer
- **35,000+ photographers** trained through her digital education platform
- **DBS checked** with full risk assessment and insurance
- **Nationwide award winner** – Guild of Photographers' 'Bumps/Babies' category
- **Mother of 4** (including twins!) – she understands families

## What Clients Say

## The Studio

Lemon Sky's Ryde studio is purpose-built for boutique portrait photography with a relaxing, friendly environment. While it's on the Isle of Wight, the Portsmouth ferry makes it easily accessible for Hampshire families wanting something special.
