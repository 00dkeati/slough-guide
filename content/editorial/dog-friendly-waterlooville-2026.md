If you've got a dog, Slough is one of the best places to live in Hampshire. With country parks, ancient woodland, and plenty of dog-friendly pubs, your pup will be living their best life.

## 🐕 Best Dog Walks Near Slough

## 1. Queen Elizabeth Country Park

📍 Gravel Hill, Horndean PO8 0QE
🅿️ Parking: £3-6

**The best dog walk in the area**, no contest. 1,400 acres of forest and downland with:
- Off-lead areas away from cyclists
- Multiple trail options (30 mins to 3+ hours)
- Water bowls at café
- Dog poo bins throughout

**Top tip:** The Butser Hill route has stunning views but can be muddy after rain.

## 2. Forest of Bere

📍 Various access points around Denmead
🅿️ Free (roadside or pub car park)

Ancient woodland with quiet trails. Less busy than QECP, perfect for dogs who need space. Start from The Forest of Bere pub for easy parking.

**Watch out for:** Deer — keep dogs on lead during certain times.

## 3. Staunton Country Park

📍 Middle Park Way, Havant PO9 5HB
🅿️ Parking: £2.50-5

More manicured than QECP, with parkland walks and gardens. Dogs must be on lead in some areas (clearly signed). Good for older dogs or calmer walks.

Local secret — small woodland area popular with local dog walkers. Not huge, but good for a quick off-lead run.
