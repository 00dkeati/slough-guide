Finding a reliable handyman in Slough shouldn't feel like winning the lottery. Yet somehow, it often does. You call three people. One never calls back. One quotes you £500 for a job that should cost £50. The third turns up, makes things worse, and vanishes.

Then there's Russ.

Handyman Russ has quietly built a reputation across Slough, Havant, and the surrounding Hampshire villages as the bloke you call when you actually want something fixed properly. His 78 Google reviews tell the story: 4.8 stars, zero drama, jobs done right.

## The Man Behind the Reviews

Based in Slough and covering Purbrook, Widley, Havant, Denmead, Horndean, Rowlands Castle, Emsworth, Cosham, and Hayling Island, Russ operates with what might be called radical simplicity: turn up when you say you will, do the job properly, clean up after yourself.

It sounds obvious. It apparently isn't.

## What He Actually Does

The list is long: bathroom fitting, window repairs, door adjustments, washing line fixes, picture hanging, flooring installation, tiling, oven fitting, handrail installation, flat-pack assembly, garden maintenance, leak detection and repair, and general property maintenance.

In other words: most things that go wrong in a house.

- **Bathroom Fitting:** Complete installations and repairs
- **General Repairs:** Windows, doors, fixtures
- **Flooring:** Vinyl, laminate, tile
- **Garden Maintenance:** Light landscaping and repairs
- **Flat-Pack Assembly:** Furniture built properly
- **Leak Detection:** Find and fix plumbing issues
- **Property Maintenance:** Ongoing care for landlords and agents

## The Reviews Tell the Story

What stands out in Russ's reviews isn't just that people are satisfied—it's the specific details they mention. The perfectionist finish. The courtesy. The tidiness.

That detail—'even matched up to existing finish'—is the kind of thing that separates a proper tradesperson from someone who just wants to get in and out.

## The Speed Factor

Another recurring theme: efficiency. Multiple reviewers mention how quickly jobs get done without sacrificing quality.

For context: most people would need three hours just to read the IKEA instructions.

## Why He Works

Russ operates with minimal overheads, no VAT, no call-out fee, and transparent pricing. He offers free, no-obligation estimates and consultations. He'll discuss how best to approach a job and offer advice—ensuring things are done properly to your specifications.

He also offers an out-of-hours service for evenings, weekends, and bank holidays—useful when the boiler decides to pack up on Christmas Eve.

## Who Uses Him

Russ works with all property types: homeowners, business premises, private landlords, and property agents. The range of his customer base speaks to his reliability—landlords don't keep using tradespeople who let them down.

## The Bottom Line

In a world of ghosting tradespeople and questionable quotes, Handyman Russ offers something refreshingly simple: competence, reliability, and a bit of old-fashioned customer service. The 78 reviews don't lie.

As one reviewer put it: 'It seems there is no job that he cannot do.'

That's probably an exaggeration. But based on the evidence, not by much.
