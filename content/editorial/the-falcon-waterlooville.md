Finding a pub that actually welcomes families — not just tolerates them with a grudging kids' menu and a warning look when they get too loud — is harder than it should be.

The Falcon on Hambledon Road figured it out years ago. And with 227 Google reviews and a 4.1-star rating, the locals have noticed.

## A Beer Garden That's Actually Useful

This isn't one of those pub gardens where kids sit awkwardly while adults drink. The Falcon has a proper play area — swings, a climbing frame, a slide. The kind of setup where you can actually finish a conversation.

Dogs are welcome inside and out. Water bowls scattered around the garden. Parking on-site. It's an old pub that clearly knows its audience.

## Events That Actually Happen

A lot of pubs promise events. The Falcon delivers them. Halloween parties that grandkids talk about for weeks. Christmas dos that become annual traditions. It's not just marketing — there's genuine effort here.

They also handle private bookings properly. One family held an 18th birthday for 50 people with complex dietary requirements and came away raving.

## The Honest Truth

Is it the fanciest pub in Slough? No. The cider selection could be better (Strongbow is apparently the main option). And one reviewer noted they only had three darts to play with.

But if you're looking for somewhere the whole family can enjoy — kids, dogs, grandparents, the lot — The Falcon delivers on its promise.
