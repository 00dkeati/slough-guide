Most driving instructors turn up, give you an hour's lesson, and leave. You're on your own until the next session.

Siobhan Towell does things differently.

As a fully qualified Government Approved Driving Instructor running her own LDC driving school, Siobhan brings something extra to every lesson: the revolutionary LD System — a structured learning approach that's helped thousands of learners pass faster and more confidently.

## The LD System: Learn Before You Drive

Here's the problem with traditional driving lessons: you're trying to learn and do at the same time. You're processing instructions while simultaneously operating a two-ton machine.

The LD System flips this. Before each lesson, you watch and study how to perform each driving task. After the lesson, you review to reinforce what you've learned. This means less time wasted on explanations in the car, and more time actually driving.

The result? You make more rapid progress. Your confidence grows as you mark off targets. Nothing is left to chance.

*Structured learning that gets results*

## Online Learning Hub

Every student gets access to Siobhan's online learning hub — available on any device. This includes:

- Theory test preparation (with practice questions)
- Hazard perception training
- The full LD System online
- Progress tracking so you can see exactly where you are

Siobhan can monitor your progress remotely and help guide you through both your theory test and practical test preparation.

## Patient, Friendly, Female Instructor

Siobhan describes herself as having a "caring, friendly personality" — and she's been specially trained by LDC in student-centred learning techniques. That means lessons are adapted to how you learn best, not a one-size-fits-all approach.

If you're nervous about learning to drive, or you've had bad experiences with instructors before, Siobhan's patient approach might be exactly what you need.

## Course Options

Siobhan offers flexible options to suit your needs:

- **Semi-intensive courses** — for those who want to learn quickly
- **Midway Pass courses** — a balance of intensity and flexibility
- **Test Booster courses** — for those nearly ready for their test
- **Pay as you go lessons** — the traditional weekly approach
- **Block bookings** — save money by booking multiple hours

Every course includes access to the online hub, the LDC driving skills DVD/workbook, and a driving test.

## Free Home Consultations

Not sure what you need? Siobhan offers free, no-obligation home visits to discuss all the options with you and your family. It's a chance to ask questions, understand the process, and make sure you're making the right choice.
