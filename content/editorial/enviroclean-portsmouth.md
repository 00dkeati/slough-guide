# Eco-Friendly Carpet Cleaner Creates 'Healthy Living Environment' for Families

**A Portsmouth-based cleaning company is winning praise for its commitment to eco-friendly methods and what customers describe as "wonderful" results.**

EnviroClean Portsmouth, owned by Dean and based in Fareham, provides professional carpet and upholstery cleaning across Hampshire, including Slough, Havant, and Horndean.

The company prides itself on creating healthier home environments through intensive deep cleaning that removes allergens and bacteria that standard vacuuming cannot reach.

"Wonderful service. Very friendly and professional. Carpets look like new," said one delighted customer. "Thank you, will definitely use again."

Another reviewer praised the quality of work: "Quick, efficient, polite, clean... did a fine job bringing an old leather suite back to life. Highly recommended."

EnviroClean's services have also impressed commercial clients. "Really efficient service, cleaned a customer of ours carpets and even with 100 years worth of soot the stain was removed, polite and really helpful with service. Will be recommending," wrote one business customer.

The company offers same-day estimates that remain valid for six months and guarantees punctuality, promising to inform customers early if any factors affect arrival times.

Dean and his team cover a wide area including Alverstoke, Cosham, Denmead, Emsworth, Fareham, Gosport, Havant, Horndean, Portsmouth, Purbrook, and Slough.
