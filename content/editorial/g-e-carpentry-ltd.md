There's a carpenter in Portsmouth who does something rare: he builds furniture people are proud of. Not "it's fine." Not "it'll do." Proud. As in, "look at this bespoke bookcase I commissioned" proud.

G E Carpentry Ltd — run by Gavin — has 25 five-star Google reviews. But it's not the volume that stands out. It's the language people use: "truly gifted," "fine craftsman work," "brilliant at design," "a perfectionist."

## The Bespoke Bookcase That Started as an Idea

Roger Batterbury had an idea. Gavin turned it into "an awesome piece of furniture."

"I'm so proud" — that's not a phrase you use about flat-pack furniture or a quick fix. That's custom work done right.

## The Kitchen That Went From "High Standard" to "Extremely Conscientious"

Laraine Rodd had a kitchen fitted. The review is short, specific, and telling:

"A perfectionist" who "consulted me all the way through" — that's someone who cares about the result, not just the invoice.

## The Imperial vs Metric Door Challenge

This is where Gavin's skill really shows. If you've got a Victorian or Edwardian house in Portsmouth, you know the pain: doorframes that are imperial measurements, modern doors that are metric, and not one straight angle in the entire property.

An anonymous reviewer called Gavin in to fit new doors throughout their home. "Not the easiest of tasks with a mixture of imperial and metric, and not one straight frame."

"A truly gifted carpenter." "Second to none." "Brilliant at design." That's not standard builder praise. That's someone who's seen the difference between adequate and excellent.

## The Flooring Job That Found Ways Around Problems

Steph Bellingham hired Gavin to fit flooring. The job had problems. Gavin found solutions.

"Fantastic at finding ways around problems" is the skill that separates good tradespeople from great ones. Anyone can follow a plan. The best ones solve problems you didn't know existed.

## The 12-Door Project With Faultless Workmanship

Robert Pilcher hired Gavin and Archie to supply and fit 12 internal doors. Then came back for 5 more. His review is worth reading in full:

Then, after the second project:

"The work is faultless." Not "really good." Faultless. That's someone who knows what to look for and found nothing wrong.

## The Numbers

- **Rating:** 5.0⭐ from 25 Google reviews
- **Common praise:** "Truly gifted," "perfectionist," "high standards," "attention to detail," "brilliant at design"
- **Specialties:** Bespoke furniture, kitchens, internal doors, flooring, worktops

## What Makes Him Different

Gavin doesn't just fit doors or build furniture. He designs solutions. He consults with clients. He handles the awkward technical challenges — imperial vs metric, not-straight frames, unexpected problems — without drama.

And when he's done, clients use words like "gifted," "perfectionist," and "faultless."

That's not marketing. That's craft.
