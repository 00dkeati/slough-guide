A working boiler is one of those things you don't think about until it stops working. Usually in January. Usually when you have guests coming.

JAW Heating Ltd understands the urgency that comes with heating problems, providing professional service to Slough homes and businesses when warmth isn't optional.

## More Than Just Repairs

While emergency callouts keep any heating company busy, JAW Heating offers the full spectrum of services. New boiler installations, system upgrades, regular servicing, and the planned work that prevents those emergency situations.

A well-maintained heating system runs more efficiently, lasts longer, and is far less likely to fail when you need it most. The annual service that feels like an unnecessary expense often pays for itself in prevented callouts.

## Getting It Right

Heating work requires proper qualifications — Gas Safe registration isn't optional, it's legal requirement. Beyond compliance, experience matters for diagnosing problems accurately and fixing them efficiently.

JAW Heating brings professional standards to every job, whether it's a quick repair or a full system installation. Cutting corners on heating work isn't just poor practice, it's potentially dangerous.

## Local Service Matters

When your heating fails, response time matters. A local company can reach you faster, knows the area, and has a reputation to maintain in the community.

JAW Heating Ltd serves the Slough area with the kind of reliable, professional service that builds word-of-mouth reputation over time.

## Year-Round Value

Smart homeowners don't wait for winter to think about heating. Summer is actually the ideal time for installations and major work — no waiting lists, no desperate urgency, just planned improvements done properly.

Whether you need emergency help or planned heating work, JAW Heating Ltd offers Slough a local, professional option.
