There's a roofing contractor in Portsmouth PO6 4EG whose phone actually rings when you call it. Where quotes arrive the same week. Where the work gets done without turning into a six-month saga involving mysterious delays and vanishing tradespeople.

It's called J P Williams Roofing, and 84 Google reviewers have left 4.9 stars' worth of opinions about them. That's not a few mates doing favours. That's a proper track record.

**Location:** 13 Deerhurst Cres, Portsmouth PO6 4EG
