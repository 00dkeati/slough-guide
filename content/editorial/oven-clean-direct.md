# Havant Oven Cleaner Champions Eco-Friendly Methods Since 2012

**An independent oven cleaning business has been transforming appliances across Hampshire for over a decade using environmentally conscious products.**

Oven Clean Direct, established by Guy in Havant in 2012, prides itself on using eco-friendly, non-caustic cleaning products that are safe for families, pets, and the environment.

"Loyal customer here! Thank you for being consistently brilliant," wrote one regular user of the service.

The owner-operated business offers a personal service and attention to detail that has earned it a loyal following across the area. Unlike larger franchise operations, Oven Clean Direct offers the consistency of having the same experienced professional handle each clean.

Guy and his team clean all types of domestic and commercial ovens, cookers, hobs, extractors, microwaves, ranges, Agas, Rayburns, and even barbecues. They can also supply and fit replacement bulbs, filters, and oven seals.

The eco-friendly approach means no unpleasant smells or odours, and ovens are ready to use immediately after cleaning with no risk of food flavour contamination.

The company covers a wide area including Portsmouth, Cosham, Drayton, Farlington, Slough, Clanfield, Horndean, Hayling, Emsworth, Southbourne, Havant, Bedhampton, and Rowlands Castle.

With two vans on the road, Oven Clean Direct can usually provide quick appointments. Urgent end-of-tenancy jobs are particularly welcomed.

The business carries full public and products liability insurance up to £2,000,000, including treatment risks and damage to property being worked upon.
