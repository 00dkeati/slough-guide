## Decade of Experience Earns Outstanding Customer Loyalty

With over 10 years of experience serving Havant, Slough, and surrounding areas, Havant Window Cleaning has built a reputation for reliability and quality that keeps customers coming back year after year.

Dean and his team operate on a professional footing that's evident in their customer feedback. "Dean has been cleaning my windows for couple of years now, brilliant at his work and fantastic communication," writes one satisfied customer on Trustpilot. The company's 4.6-star rating across 22 reviews reflects consistently high standards that have earned them long-term clients.

The business employs modern water-fed pole systems, working from the safety of the ground while achieving superior results. Their pure water system leaves windows streak-free as they dry naturally, eliminating the need for harsh chemicals. Traditional window cleaning methods remain available for customers who prefer them.

Communication stands out as a hallmark of their service. "Excellent customer service. Tops for communication. You receive a email or text to let you know what date they turning up. Always a good clean," one reviewer notes. This attention to customer experience extends to flexible payment systems and prompt responses to enquiries.

The company's responsiveness impresses clients. One customer recounts: "Had to contact recently as I needed an extra clean due to a pigeon flying into my window. Arrived within the hour." This kind of service has earned praise repeatedly, with reviewers describing staff as "friendly and well presented" and "polite and courteous."

Beyond standard window cleaning, Havant Window Cleaning offers fascia and soffit cleaning, conservatory roof cleaning, gutter clearance, solar panel cleaning, and patio cleaning using flat surface cleaners that minimise mess. As one long-term client puts it: "I have been having my Windows cleaned by Dean for a long time now. Fantastic, reliable service...would highly recommend to any one looking for a professional window cleaner."
