There are massages that feel relaxing in the moment, and then there are massages that actually solve problems. The difference matters when you're carrying chronic tension or nursing an injury.

A Touch Of Asia on London Road in Cowplain has carved out a niche doing the latter. The reviews tell the story: "I went for a deep tissue massage to fix my neck pain. The following day the pain was gone."

That's not relaxation — that's therapy.

## Traditional Techniques, Practical Results

The massage menu draws on traditional Chinese and Thai techniques — methods that have been refined over centuries in cultures where massage isn't an occasional luxury but a regular part of wellness maintenance.

The staff have extensive training in these therapies, and it shows in the results. Whether you're dealing with knotted muscles from desk work, recovering from a sports injury, or just carrying the physical burden of stress that life keeps piling on, there's a treatment designed for your specific situation.

## What's On Offer

**Full Body Relaxing Massage** — The classic. Covers back, legs, arms, shoulders, head and feet. Good for circulation, sleep quality, and generally feeling human again.

**Deep Tissue Massage** — The problem-solver. Sustained pressure, slow strokes, targeting the inner layers of muscles and connective tissue. This is what breaks up the knots and releases chronic tension. Popular with athletes and anyone who's spent too long hunched over a laptop.

As the spa notes, massage works best as a regular practice rather than an emergency measure. "Like going to your hairdresser," they suggest — and they're not wrong.

## The Practical Stuff

Location-wise, A Touch Of Asia couldn't be more convenient. Right on the A3 in Cowplain, easily accessible from the A3(M). And crucially: **free parking** behind Banks Fish & Chips, with a paid council car park directly behind the spa if needed.

The hours are sensible for working people — open until 8:30pm, so you don't have to take time off work for self-care.

They do ask that you book appointments rather than dropping in unannounced. It's a small operation focused on quality, not a walk-in factory. WhatsApp booking is available if phone calls aren't your thing.

## One Reviewer's Verdict
