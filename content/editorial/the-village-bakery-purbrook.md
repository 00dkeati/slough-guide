There's a café in Purbrook that regulars describe in almost religious terms. The kind of place where people say 'I'd be there every Saturday morning if I could.' The kind of place where the doughnuts sell out and people plan their visits around them.

The Village Bakery has 161 Google reviews and a 4.5-star rating. For a local café in a village that most people only drive through, that's remarkable.

## The Purbrook Porker

Yes, that's actually what it's called. The Village Bakery has leaned into its identity as a proper, no-nonsense breakfast spot. The mega breakfast is the stuff of local legend — portions so generous that reviewers can't quite believe the price.

## The Doughnut Situation

This is not a drill: the doughnuts sell out. Regulars know to get in early. Birthday celebrations have been built around them. They're that good.

## More Than Just Breakfast

While the breakfasts get the headlines, the Village Bakery is a proper all-rounder. They do birthday brunches (message ahead to book). They do Christmas specials — their Christmas chips apparently need to be experienced. They do the little things right.
