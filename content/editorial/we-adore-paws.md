**Contact:** 07465 215856 **Location:** Slough and surrounding areas **Service Type:** Dog walking and pet care services

We Adore Paws brings enthusiasm and dedication to pet care services across Slough, with a business philosophy centred on genuine affection for animals rather than purely commercial considerations.

The service provides dog walking for working pet owners, elderly dog owners with mobility limitations, and households managing multiple dogs who benefit from professional exercise sessions. Individual walks cater to dogs preferring solo attention, whilst group walks offer socialisation for more gregarious animals.

Beyond basic walking services, We Adore Paws offers home visits for feeding, medication administration, and companionship during owner absences. This proves particularly valuable for animals who experience stress when removed from familiar environments, including elderly dogs, anxious cats, and small pets.

The business operates with flexibility regarding booking arrangements, accommodating irregular schedules and last-minute requests where possible. This adaptability suits clients with unpredictable working patterns or those requiring occasional cover rather than regular commitments.

Local knowledge of Slough's parks, woodland areas, and quiet walking routes allows the service to select appropriate environments for different dog temperaments. Nervous dogs benefit from quieter locations away from busy roads and large crowds, whilst confident, energetic breeds receive more stimulating routes with varied terrain.

For Slough residents seeking pet care from operators who genuinely prioritise animal welfare, We Adore Paws offers personal service with evident passion for the work.
