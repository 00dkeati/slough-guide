Denise had tried gyms before. The intimidating equipment. The crowded floors. The feeling that everyone was watching. It never stuck.

Then she found Jack Williamson PT — a private studio tucked away in a back garden off Tempest Avenue in Slough. No distractions. No judgement. Just results.

## The Back Garden Gym

Three years ago, Jack converted his back garden into a fully-equipped private gym. State-of-the-art equipment. Completely private. No gym bros hogging the squat rack.

It's an unusual setup, but it works. His clients don't have to brave the intimidating atmosphere of a commercial gym. They just show up, work hard, and leave stronger.

## More Than Just Sessions

What separates Jack from other trainers isn't just the hour you spend with him — it's everything in between.

Every client gets access to his Trainerize app with personalised workout plans, meal guides, and direct messaging. Bad day? Send Jack a message. Need motivation? He's there.

## Real Results

The testimonials speak for themselves. Weight loss. Improved posture. Increased confidence. People who never thought they'd enjoy exercise, now looking forward to their sessions.

## Balancing Life and Fitness

Most of Jack's clients aren't fitness fanatics. They're busy people — parents, professionals, people who've struggled to make exercise stick.
