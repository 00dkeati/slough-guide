We've all been there. That car on the drive that's seen better days. The one you keep meaning to do something about but never quite get round to. Too much hassle to sell privately, not worth enough for a main dealer to care.

**Cash for Cars Hampshire** has built a business on solving exactly that problem for people across the Havant and wider Hampshire area.

## No Faff, Just Cash

Based at 204 Middle Park Way in Havant, this motor trader specialises in buying vehicles directly from owners. No endless tyre-kickers from Facebook Marketplace. No waiting weeks for someone to "definitely come and see it on Saturday." Just a straightforward valuation and cash in your pocket.

The service covers cars, vans, and vehicles in pretty much any condition — whether it's a decent runner you've upgraded from or something that's been sitting there gathering moss.

## Why Local Matters

Big online car-buying outfits have their place, but there's something to be said for dealing with someone local. Questions get answered by a person, not a chatbot. Payments happen face-to-face. And if something needs sorting, they're just down the road rather than hiding behind an 0800 number.

For Slough and Havant residents looking to clear a vehicle without the drama, it's worth a call.
