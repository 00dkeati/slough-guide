## Types of Loft Conversion Explained

### Velux / Roof Light Conversion
The simplest and cheapest option. Windows are installed into the existing roof slope — no structural changes to the roofline. Best for home offices or storage.

**Cost:** £15,000 - £25,000

### Dormer Loft Conversion
The most popular choice in Hampshire. A box-shaped extension is built out from the roof, creating full headroom and vertical walls. Can be rear, side, or front-facing.

**Cost:** £30,000 - £50,000

### Hip to Gable Conversion
Ideal for semi-detached and end-terrace homes with hipped (sloping) roofs. The sloped side is extended to create a vertical gable wall, dramatically increasing space.

**Cost:** £40,000 - £65,000

### Mansard Conversion
The roof slope is changed to near-vertical (72°), maximising internal space. Often used on terraced Victorian/Edwardian homes. Usually requires planning permission.

**Cost:** £50,000 - £75,000

- Planning & design: 10-15%
- Contingency: 10% (for unexpected issues)

### How long does a loft conversion take?
Most loft conversions in Hampshire take **6-8 weeks** from start to finish. A simple Velux conversion may take just 2-3 weeks, while a complex mansard or hip-to-gable could take 10-12 weeks.

### Do I need planning permission for a loft conversion in Hampshire?
**Usually no.** Most loft conversions fall under Permitted Development rights. However, you'll need planning permission if your home is listed, in a conservation area, or if the conversion exceeds size limits. You will always need Building Regulations approval.

### Will a loft conversion add value to my Hampshire home?
Yes. A loft conversion typically adds **15-20% to your property value**. On an average Hampshire home worth £350,000, that's £52,500-£70,000 of added value — far more than the conversion costs.

### Can my house have a loft conversion?
Most Hampshire houses can have a loft conversion if there's at least **2.2m head height** at the highest point of the existing loft. A surveyor can assess suitability — most companies offer free surveys.

### What's the best type of loft conversion?
For most Hampshire homes, a **rear dormer** offers the best balance of cost, space, and planning ease. Hip-to-gable works well for semi-detached homes. Your installer can advise based on your roof type.

### How do I find a good loft conversion company?
Get at least 3 quotes, check recent reviews (2025/2026), ask for references, visit a completed project if possible, and ensure they handle Building Regulations. All companies on this page have been vetted.

### What is the 10 year rule for loft conversions?
The **10-year rule** (changed from 4 years in April 2024) means an unauthorised loft conversion becomes immune from council enforcement if it has existed unchallenged for 10 years. However, this **only applies to planning permission** — Building Regulations can be enforced at any time. Non-compliance with Building Regs affects safety and can block property sales or mortgages. Always get proper approvals.

### Which lofts cannot be converted?
Lofts generally can't be converted if they have **insufficient headroom** (need 2.2m across half the floor), **trussed roofs** (W-shaped, common in post-1960s homes), or if you're in a **listed building or conservation area**. Flat owners who don't own the freehold also can't convert. However, solutions like dormer or mansard conversions can add headroom to otherwise unsuitable lofts.

### What is the minimum head height for a loft conversion?
Building Regulations require a minimum of **2.2 metres head height** across at least half the floor area after conversion. If your existing loft doesn't meet this, a dormer or mansard conversion can add the necessary height.

### Can you do a loft conversion for £20k?
**Very unlikely in 2026.** The cheapest loft conversions (basic Velux/roof light) now start around £25,000-£30,000. A £20k budget might cover a non-habitable storage conversion without Building Regulations, but not a proper bedroom or living space. Budget at least £25,000-£40,000 for the simplest habitable conversion.

### What is the cheapest way to convert a loft?
The **Velux or roof light conversion** is cheapest at £25,000-£40,000. It involves adding windows to the existing roof slope without structural changes. Best for home offices or storage where full headroom isn't critical. For a proper bedroom, a rear dormer (£40,000+) is usually the most cost-effective option.

### What is the most expensive part of a loft conversion?
**Structural work and labour** typically account for 50-60% of the cost. This includes steel beams, floor strengthening, dormers, and the staircase. Other big costs: the staircase itself (£3,000-£8,000), en-suite bathroom (£5,000-£10,000), and windows (£1,000-£3,000 each).

### What are the common problems with loft conversions?
Common issues include: **insufficient headroom** (need 2.2m), **trussed roofs** (need structural changes), **party wall disputes** with neighbours, **planning permission** issues in conservation areas, **staircase positioning** (where does it go?), and **building regulations compliance**. Always get a proper survey first.

### What's the best time of year for a loft conversion?
**Spring (March-May) or early autumn (September-October)** are ideal. Weather is mild for roof work, and you avoid the busy summer holiday period when builders are in high demand. Winter is possible but may cause delays due to weather. Book 2-3 months ahead for popular times.

### Do you need to inform neighbours about a loft conversion?
**Yes, if you share a wall.** Terraced and semi-detached homes require a **Party Wall Agreement** under the Party Wall Act 1996. You must notify neighbours in writing at least 2 months before work starts. They can consent or appoint a surveyor. Detached homes generally don't need this.

### Is a loft conversion worth it in 2025/2026?
**Yes, for most homeowners.** A loft conversion adds 15-20% to property value (£50,000-£80,000 on a typical Hampshire home) while costing £40,000-£70,000. It's cheaper than moving and avoids stamp duty. ROI is especially good in areas with high property prices like Hampshire.

### Do you need stairs for a loft conversion?
**Yes, for a habitable room.** Building Regulations require a fixed staircase (not a ladder) for any loft used as a bedroom or living space. The staircase must provide safe escape in case of fire. Ladders are only acceptable for non-habitable storage lofts.

### Can you sleep in a converted loft?
**Only if it meets Building Regulations.** A loft bedroom must have: proper staircase access, fire doors, smoke alarms, adequate headroom (2.2m+), an escape window or protected route, and proper insulation. Sleeping in a non-compliant loft is unsafe and can affect insurance and property sales.

### What is the 2.5 metre rule for loft conversions?
The **2.5 metre rule** refers to permitted development limits. Under PD rights, a rear dormer cannot extend more than 2.5 metres beyond the original roof slope at its highest point. Exceeding this requires planning permission. Front dormers typically aren't allowed under PD at all.

### Can I put stairs to my loft without planning permission?
**Usually yes** — internal alterations like staircases don't normally need planning permission. However, you will need **Building Regulations approval** to ensure the staircase meets fire safety and structural requirements. The position of the staircase and its impact on rooms below must be carefully planned.
