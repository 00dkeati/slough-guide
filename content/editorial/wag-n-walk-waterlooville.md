Dogs don't care if it's raining. They still need their walk.

Wag 'n' Walk gets this. Six days a week, whatever the weather, they're out there. Time slots designed to suit your needs, not theirs.

## More Than Just Walks

The service ranges from individual dog walks through to in-home boarding. Whether you need someone while you're at work, out for the day, or away on holiday — Wag 'n' Walk has you covered.

## Qualified and Insured

Wag 'n' Walk is fully insured and run by a qualified animal carer. That combination of formal qualification and proper insurance means you can rest assured your pet is in professional hands.

## Local Service, Personal Touch

This is a great local service — not a franchise, not a big company. It's someone who knows the area, knows the best walking spots, and can offer the personal touch that bigger operations can't.

## Favourite Walking Spots

The Wag 'n' Walk gallery shows dogs enjoying Butser Hill, the New Forest, and other local beauty spots. Your dog gets variety — not the same circuit around the block every day.

## Areas Covered

Wag 'n' Walk covers Slough, Cosham, Havant, and surrounding areas.
