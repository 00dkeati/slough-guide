There's a roofing contractor in Havant PO9 3LJ whose phone actually rings when you call it. Where quotes arrive the same week. Where the work gets done without turning into a six-month saga involving mysterious delays and vanishing tradespeople.

It's called Bakes Roofing, and 13 Google reviewers have left 4 stars' worth of opinions about them. That's not a few mates doing favours. That's a proper track record.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

**Reviews:** 13  
**Phone:** 07769 971371 (yes, it's a mobile — they actually answer)  
**Location:** 48 Lower Rd, Havant PO9 3LJ

When you've got 13 reviews on Google, patterns emerge. And the pattern here is: people call Bakes, Bakes shows up, Bakes fixes the roof, people write nice things online.

Bakes Roofing has 13 reviews because they keep showing up. The work gets done. The phone gets answered. That's not revolutionary — it's just rare.
