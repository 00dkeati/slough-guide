There's a roofing contractor in Slough PO7 7DT whose phone actually rings when you call it. Where quotes arrive the same week. Where the work gets done without turning into a six-month saga involving mysterious delays and vanishing tradespeople.

It's called K & S Roofing Ltd, and 16 Google reviewers have left 4.9 stars' worth of opinions about them. That's not a few mates doing favours. That's a proper track record.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

**Reviews:** 16  
**Phone:** 07425 578265 (yes, it's a mobile — they actually answer)  
**Location:** 23a, Slough PO7 7DT

When you've got 16 reviews on Google, patterns emerge. And the pattern here is: people call K, K shows up, K fixes the roof, people write nice things online.

K & S Roofing Ltd has 16 reviews because they keep showing up. The work gets done. The phone gets answered. That's not revolutionary — it's just rare.
