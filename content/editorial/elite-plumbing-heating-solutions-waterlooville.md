When Ricky from **Elite Plumbing Heating Solutions** arrives at your door, you're getting more than a plumber—you're getting three decades of expertise, Gas Safe certification, and the kind of meticulous workmanship that earns Google's rare "Trustindex Verified" badge. Only companies with review scores above 4.5 over 12 months qualify. Elite doesn't just meet that standard—they consistently exceed it.

## The Reputation Speaks for Itself

"Very professional, knowledgeable. Did the job and cleaned up afterwards. Sensible price for a good job," writes one customer after an emergency call-out. But it's another review that truly captures what sets Elite apart: "Ricky's knowledge, experience, and expertise are outstanding...It was refreshing to deal with someone so open and honest."

In an industry where upselling unnecessary work is common, that honesty is rare and valuable. Ricky takes time to explain options clearly, ensuring homeowners feel informed rather than pressured. It's an approach that's earned Elite an exceptional reputation across Slough, Havant, Portsmouth, and surrounding areas.
