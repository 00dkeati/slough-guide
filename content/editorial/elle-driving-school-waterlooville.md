Let's talk numbers.

The average driving test pass rate in Hampshire is 48%. That means if you pick a random driving instructor, you've got roughly a coin-flip chance of passing your test.

At Elle Driving School? The pass rate is 75%.

That's not luck. That's not a fluke. That's 25 years of knowing exactly what examiners are looking for and how to get learners ready.

## Grade A — The Highest Standard

The DVSA doesn't hand out Grade A ratings to just anyone. It's the highest standard a driving instructor can achieve — reserved for those who demonstrate exceptional teaching ability.

Elle's instructor holds a Grade A rating. She's been doing this since 1999. That's over a quarter of a century of teaching people to drive safely.

## Why 75%?

What makes the difference between a 48% pass rate and a 75% pass rate?

Experience. A Grade A instructor who's been teaching for 25 years knows every mistake a learner can make — and how to prevent them before test day. She knows the local test routes inside out. She knows what examiners look for. She knows how to build confidence without cutting corners.

That's not something you can fake or shortcut. It takes decades to develop.

## Female Instructor

Some learners feel more comfortable with a female instructor. Maybe it's nerves. Maybe it's preference. Maybe it's just wanting someone who feels approachable.

Elle Driving School offers exactly that — experienced, patient, professional teaching from a woman who's dedicated her career to helping people pass.

## The Car

You'll learn in a Toyota Yaris — one of the most popular cars for driving instruction in the UK. It's fitted with:

- Dual controls (for safety)
- Manual gearbox (the standard for UK tests)
- Air conditioning (because learners get nervous, and nervous people get warm)

It's safe. It's reliable. It's comfortable. And crucially — it's easy to drive. The last thing you need when you're learning is a car that fights against you.

## Registered Pass Plus Instructor

Pass Plus is the post-test training scheme that helps new drivers build confidence on motorways, in bad weather, and at night. Elle's instructor is a registered Pass Plus instructor — so your training doesn't have to end when you pass your test.

## Areas Covered

Elle covers a wide area around Slough: Cowplain, Horndean, Clanfield, Denmead, Bedhampton, Havant, Hayling Island, Drayton, Leigh Park, and Emsworth.

Work or college pickups can be arranged — making it easier to fit lessons around your schedule.

## The Bottom Line

You can gamble on a 48% pass rate with an unknown instructor. Or you can go with someone who's been doing this for 25 years, holds the highest DVSA grade, and gets three-quarters of her students through first time.

The choice is yours.
