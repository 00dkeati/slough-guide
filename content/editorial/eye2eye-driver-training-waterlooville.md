There are driving instructors. And then there's Latch Drepaul.

Since 1998, Latch has been an Approved Driving Instructor — but his CV reads more like a military operation than a typical ADI career. He started with the British School of Motoring in Central London and Surrey, quickly rising to become a trainer for the ADI Part 2 Exam. That's right: he was teaching other instructors how to drive.

Then came the Ministry of Defence.

## Training the Military

As a sub-contractor instructor for the MOD, Latch worked at military camps across the country — Blandford (Signals), Minley (Engineers), Military Police, and Southwick. His job? Driver training for military personnel.

When soldiers need to learn to drive safely in high-pressure situations, they don't call just anyone. They call instructors with Latch's calibre.

## Zero Fault Passes

It's one thing to help someone scrape through their test. It's another to have students walking out with zero faults. Latch's students don't just pass — they pass convincingly.

## Teaching the Next Generation

Latch has also been part of the YOUNG Driver Instructor Team, teaching driver education to under-17s — some as young as 11. It's a scheme that starts driver awareness early, and Latch believes in it passionately.

He's attended courses with the Driving Instructor Association on training clients with diverse needs and driver behaviour coaching. Whatever your situation, Latch has the skills to adapt.

## The Instructor, Not the Shouter

Bad driving instructors shout. Good ones stay calm. Great ones make you feel like you're driving with a friend.

## First Time Passes Across Hampshire

The testimonials keep coming. First time passes. Minimal faults. Confidence built from the ground up.

## The Car

You'll learn in a Toyota Aygo X — a sporty 1-litre crossover in gold and black. Built-in sat nav, reversing camera, front and back sensors, automatic lights. It's lovely to drive and easy to park.

## From London to the South Coast

Originally from London, Latch has been based on the South Coast since 2007. In his own words: "I have sat next to many clients from all walks of life and different backgrounds — from the fast pace of London to the tranquil pace of villages."

"I get to know you and you get to know me. I will strive to pass on my expertise and knowledge of the roads to you. With us working as a team, we should achieve our goals: Expert Driver Training, Leading to Safe Driving. Reducing the Risk but maximising the Safety."
