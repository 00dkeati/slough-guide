Finding a hairdresser who actually understands curly hair is harder than it should be. Too many salons treat curls like a problem to be solved rather than a texture to be celebrated.

Sabrina's Hair Lounge in Slough has built its reputation on being different. With 37 Google reviews and a 4.4-star rating, the word is spreading among the curly-haired community.

## The Curl Specialist

Sabrina offers a complete curl package that includes detox treatments, Olaplex, and the kind of scalp massage that makes you forget the outside world exists. But it's her knowledge that sets her apart.
