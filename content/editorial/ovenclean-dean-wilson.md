# Family Oven Cleaning Team Leaves Customers 'Speechless' with Results

**A husband and wife team running an Ovenclean franchise since 2013 has built a loyal customer base across Portsmouth and Hampshire with their professional approach.**

Dean and Amy Wilson started their Ovenclean franchise over a decade ago and have since grown the business to include Dean's brother Mark and nephew George, allowing them to cover a larger area.

The family operation has earned consistently excellent reviews for leaving ovens looking "just as if they came from the showroom."

"We have just had our oven cleaned by Dean Wilson in Portsmouth, and not only was he so helpful and friendly, the oven is amazing - I was speechless," wrote one impressed customer. "It is just as if it has come from the showroom. Thank you so much for this and we are on his return list for next year."

Another Slough customer praised the reliability: "Dean came promptly and on time. An explanation was given straight away of how the cleaning would progress. Ovens and internal trays are now as new and sparkly clean. Job well done and would have no hesitation in recommending Dean."

The team covers Portsmouth, Southsea, Gosport, Slough, Fareham, Lee-on-Solent, Hayling Island, Emsworth, Havant, and Rowlands Castle.

Services include ovens, hobs, extractor hoods, microwaves, barbecues, Agas and range cookers. Operating hours are Monday to Saturday, 8am to 7pm.

Customers particularly appreciate Dean's professionalism and communication: "Always on time, very chatty, and when he leaves everything is clean and tidy - a true gent and perfectionist."
