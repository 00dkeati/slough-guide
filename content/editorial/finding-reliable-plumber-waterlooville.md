It's happened to all of us. Water's gushing where it shouldn't be, panic sets in, and suddenly you're frantically Googling 'emergency plumber near me' at 11pm. In that moment of desperation, you're vulnerable to cowboys, inflated prices, and shoddy work.

But it doesn't have to be that way. We've spoken to dozens of Slough residents, analyzed hundreds of reviews, and consulted with trading standards to bring you the definitive guide to finding a reliable plumber.

## The Red Flags You Can't Ignore

- **No fixed address:** If they can't give you a business address in Slough or surrounding areas, walk away.
- **Cash only:** While many tradespeople prefer cash, being ONLY willing to accept cash is suspicious.
- **Pressure tactics:** 'I can do it now but only if you decide in the next 10 minutes' is a classic cowboy move.
- **No written quote:** Any professional plumber will provide a written estimate before starting work.
- **Unusually cheap:** If it's significantly cheaper than other quotes, there's usually a reason—and it's not good.

## What Good Looks Like

A reliable Slough plumber will have most or all of these: Gas Safe registration (if working with gas), public liability insurance, references you can check, transparent pricing, and they'll explain the problem in terms you understand without being condescending.

## The Slough Advantage

Living in Slough actually works in your favour when finding tradespeople. The town is small enough that reputation matters—cowboys can't hide for long. Check local Facebook groups, ask your neighbours, and read recent Google reviews. The same names keep coming up for good reason.

Most importantly, a local plumber has skin in the game. They live here, work here, and their reputation in the community matters to them. That accountability is worth its weight in gold.
