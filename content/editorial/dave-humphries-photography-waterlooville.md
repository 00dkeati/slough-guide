Every wedding photographer has a style. Dave Humphries, working from Slough, has something different: an anti-formula.

'Here's the thing with wedding photography,' Dave explains. 'Every wedding is different and every couple is unique. Plus every wedding photographer has their own style and approach. My approach is friendly and relaxed, recognising that this is your big day and so I need to tailor what I do entirely around you.'

## No Formula Photography

'There's no formula photography with me, but working with you to get great pictures that tell your story in the way you want.'

This means every couple gets a genuinely bespoke experience. Dave takes time to understand what matters to you, what moments you want captured, and how you want to remember your day.

## Beyond Weddings

While weddings are Dave's primary focus, he also offers portrait photography – whether just you, your family, or special events like proms, graduations, and birthdays.

## Local Expertise

Being based in Slough gives Dave intimate knowledge of local venues and the Hampshire area. He covers weddings across Hampshire, West Sussex, Surrey, and Salisbury, and is happy to travel for destination weddings and elopements.
