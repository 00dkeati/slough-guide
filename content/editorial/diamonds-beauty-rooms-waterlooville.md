Thirty-three years. That's how long Diamonds Beauty Rooms has been operating on Hambledon Parade in Slough. In an industry where trends change faster than nail polish dries, staying power like that says something.

What it says, according to the hundreds of reviews they've accumulated, is that this team knows how to make people feel genuinely looked after.

## More Than Just a Salon

"Best massage I've ever had," writes Deborah T, after her first visit for a Swedish massage with Jasmine. "Can't wait to come back. Pure heaven."

It's not an isolated opinion. The reviews paint a consistent picture: skilled therapists, a calm environment, and the kind of attention to detail that turns first-timers into regulars.

"Been going there for years with never a bad experience," notes Jan B. That's the kind of loyalty you can't buy — you have to earn it, appointment by appointment.

## What They Offer

Diamonds isn't a one-trick salon. The service menu covers pretty much everything you'd want:

- **Nails** — Acrylics, gel, builder gel, and intricate designs
- **Facials** — Including ELEMIS Biotec (the fancy technology-driven ones) and traditional hands-on treatments
- **Massage** — Swedish, deep tissue, and stress-melting options
- **Eyes** — Lash extensions, lash lifts, brow lamination
- **Waxing & Threading** — For when you need things tidied up

The ELEMIS partnership is worth noting — it's a premium skincare brand, and not every local salon invests at that level.

## The Team

Names keep coming up in reviews: Gemma, Kelly, Jasmine, Hannah. Each seems to have their regulars, their specialties, their fans.

"Gemma was amazing and so welcoming, put me at ease," writes Jan B about her waxing appointment. "So thorough, and as painless as can be."

"My massage with Kelly was fabulous," says Vanessa K. "She certainly found my most tense areas and smoothed them away."

"Hannah did my gel nails beautifully," adds Carol A. "She has a lovely personality and it's enjoyable chatting with her whilst she works."

## The Vibe

"Calm, clean, friendly salon," summarises Kearna P. "Highly recommended."

Becca M goes further: "Spacious, warm and welcoming. All the staff are really friendly, great at putting you at ease."

For a beauty salon, atmosphere matters. Nobody wants to relax in chaos. Diamonds seems to have figured out that the experience starts the moment you walk through the door.
