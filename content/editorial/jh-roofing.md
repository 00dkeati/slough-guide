There's a roofing contractor in Slough PO8 9UU whose phone actually rings when you call it. Where quotes arrive the same week. Where the work gets done without turning into a six-month saga involving mysterious delays and vanishing tradespeople.

It's called JH Roofing, and 22 Google reviewers have left 5 stars' worth of opinions about them. That's not a few mates doing favours. That's a proper track record.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

**Reviews:** 22  
**Phone:** 07375 547904 (yes, it's a mobile — they actually answer)

JH Roofing has 22 reviews because they keep showing up. The work gets done. The phone gets answered. That's not revolutionary — it's just rare.
