There's a carpentry firm operating out of Farlington Road that does something rare in the building trade: they answer their phone, turn up when they say they will, and finish jobs to a standard that makes people write Google reviews unprompted.

Hatton Carpentry Ltd — run by Charlie Hatton with carpenter Sam — has 60 five-star reviews. Not 60 reviews averaging 4.8 stars. Sixty reviews. All five stars. Every single one.

## The IKEA Wardrobe That Didn't Look Like IKEA

Fenella Hawker needed IKEA PAX wardrobes fitted to look like a built-in unit. She also had a dodgy boiler cupboard door that needed fixing. She called Hatton Carpentry.

That last bit — "left the space very clean & tidy at the end of the day & also when he completed the work" — is the kind of detail people only mention when it's unusual.

## Twelve Doors, Zero Wonky Frames

Keith Coates contacted Hatton Carpentry about replacing all his internal doors. Charlie came round, provided guidance, quoted, supplied the doors and door furniture, then fitted them.

"Care and attention to detail" is code for "the hinges are flush, the shut lines are even, and the handles don't wobble." It's rarer than it should be.

## The Custom Door That Fits a Small Office Perfectly

When standard sizes don't work, you need someone who can make a door that fits. Not "close enough." Fits.

"Smooth and stress-free" is what happens when someone knows what they're doing and communicates clearly.

## Ten Doors, Excellent Finish, Would Use Again

Esther Sparrow had 10 internal doors fitted. Her review is short, specific, and telling.

"Would definitely... use again" is the highest compliment in the building trade. It means you'd let them back into your house.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

60 reviews. 5.0 stars. Not one complaint about missed appointments, poor finishing, or surprise costs. That's not luck. That's a system.

- **Perfect rating:** 5.0⭐ from 60 Google reviews
- **Common praise:** "Professional," "punctual," "attention to detail," "clean and tidy"
- **Specialties:** Internal doors, custom carpentry, IKEA fitting, door furniture
- **Quote speed:** Fast but reasonable — mentioned multiple times

## What Makes Them Different

Joseph Oliver's review captures it:

Fast quote. Reasonable price. Two weeks later, job done to a "brilliant standard." No drama. No delays. No excuses.

That's the system.
