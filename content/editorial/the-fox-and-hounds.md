There's a pub on Stakes Hill Road where the landlord knows your dog's name before he knows yours. Where the Sunday roasts bring families back week after week. Where a grieving son held his father's wake and left calling it "a credit to the community."

The Fox & Hounds isn't trying to be trendy. It's just trying to be good – and 250 Google reviews say it's succeeding.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

At 4.4 stars from 250 reviews, this Slough local has earned its reputation the old-fashioned way: proper pints, honest pub grub, and staff who actually care.

## The Food That Brings Families Back

The food? "Fantastic roast dinner," says one family. "Loved the ambience and fish & chips," says another. Prices stay firmly in "won't need a second mortgage" territory.

## More Than Just a Pub

Wednesday's quiz night has become a local institution (regulars admit they rarely win, but keep showing up anyway). The beer garden's a proper sun trap. Dogs welcome. Kids get their own corner with a TV.

## When It Really Matters

But it's the human touches that stand out. When Dan and the team hosted a wake, they "made everything so smooth... accommodated every request with empathy."

That's not training. That's heart.
