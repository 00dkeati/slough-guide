Let's be honest: learning to drive isn't cheap.

By the time you've paid for lessons, theory test, practical test, and everything else, you're looking at a significant investment. The last thing you need is an instructor charging premium prices for average teaching.

1-Drive School of Motoring gets this. Their pricing is transparent, competitive, and designed to make quality instruction accessible.

## The Numbers

- **£40/hour** — standard weekday rate
- **£38/hour** — when you block book 10 hours (that's a £20 saving)
- **£45/hour** — unsociable hours (before 8am, after 5pm, weekends)

Compare that to some driving schools charging £50+ per hour. The savings add up fast.

*Quality instruction at prices that make sense*

## What You Get

Low prices don't mean low quality. Every lesson includes:

- High-quality instruction from experienced instructors
- Modern vehicles with dual controls
- 2-hour lessons as standard (enough time to make real progress)
- Flexible scheduling around your life
- The option to take your test in their car OR your own

That last point is unusual. Many schools insist you take the test in their car. 1-Drive gives you the choice — whatever makes you most comfortable.

## High Pass Rates

1-Drive doesn't just offer cheap lessons — they get results. Their instructors consistently achieve high pass rates, proving that affordable doesn't mean cutting corners.

## 2-Hour Lessons

All lessons are typically 2 hours. Why? Because one-hour lessons are often not long enough to make meaningful progress. By the time you've settled in and warmed up, the lesson's nearly over.

Two hours gives you time to actually learn — to make mistakes, correct them, and reinforce good habits before the session ends.
