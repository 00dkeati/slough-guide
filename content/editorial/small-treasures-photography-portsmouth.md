The first weeks of your baby's life pass in a blur of sleepless nights and overwhelming love. Those tiny fingers, peaceful sleeping faces, and first stretches – they're gone before you know it.

Susi Turner at Small Treasures Photography has made it her mission to capture these fleeting moments. Based in Portsmouth, she's built a reputation as one of Hampshire's premier newborn and maternity photographers.

## Professional Credentials

Small Treasures Photography isn't just another baby photography studio. Susi is a distinguished member of the prestigious Xperience Group of photographers in the UK and Ireland, as well as the Baby and Newborn Photography Network – organisations that promote the highest standards of safety and professionalism.

She's also multi-award-winning, with years of experience specialising in fine art newborn photography.

## The Philosophy

'The birth of a child and the start of a new life surely is the most treasured and defining moment in life,' Susi explains. 'The first few days of your baby's life are unique, magical and life changing. Only a few weeks after entering into this world your baby will already be changing rapidly and never be the same again.'

'You only get one chance to capture your baby's earliest days—a moment that will never come again.'
