It's 6am on a Sunday. Your car won't start. The battery's dead, the clutch feels wrong, or there's a noise that definitely wasn't there yesterday. Most mechanics? Closed until Monday. Dan from D.N Motor Services? He answers his phone.

With 151 Google reviews and a 4.7-star rating, this Slough-based mobile mechanic has built a reputation on one simple premise: he comes to you, he's honest, and he doesn't rip you off.

## The Sunday Morning Saviour

Sarah Kendell messaged Dan on a Sunday morning, not really expecting a reply. "Didn't really expect an answer till the following day being a Sunday," she recalls. "But not only did he respond, he came round a couple of hours later, diagnosed the problem..."

It's a pattern that repeats across his reviews. Tim's son's Kia Picanto wouldn't start: "He arrived within the hour and immediately diagnosed a flat battery. He quickly sourced a new one which was fitted without any problem."

## The Honest Mechanic (Yes, They Exist)

But what really sets Dan apart is his honesty. Lee Roberts booked through ClickMechanic expecting clutch work. Dan could have easily charged for a full replacement.

That integrity shows up repeatedly in reviews. One customer notes: "Honest hard working man who brought my quoted price down over 1/3 from Mercedes."

## When Your Van Is Your Livelihood

For tradespeople, a broken-down van isn't an inconvenience – it's lost income. Ratty Powell's alternator cable snapped on a Friday afternoon. He needed his van for the weekend.

## Going the Extra Mile (Literally)

Kirstie needed a part urgently. Most mechanics would tell you to wait. Dan drove two hours to collect it.
