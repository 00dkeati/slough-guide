Cat owners know the guilt. You're on holiday, supposedly relaxing, but wondering if your cat is stressed, hiding in a corner, refusing to eat. Denmead Cattery has figured out how to fix that.

With 37 reviews and a 4.8-star rating, Sue has built something special — a cattery where cats actually seem happy, and owners get photo and video updates to prove it.

## The Photo Updates

It's a small thing that makes a huge difference. Regular photos and videos of your cat, looking relaxed and content. Proof that they're okay. Peace of mind you can't put a price on.
