Five years in a row. That's how long Lovely Chops has been rated among the top three dog groomers in Portsmouth. In an industry where reputation is everything, that kind of consistency speaks volumes.

Run by Emily and her team, Lovely Chops has spent over a decade perfecting their craft — and more importantly, perfecting the experience for the dogs who come through their doors.

## The Freehand Difference

Here's something that sets Lovely Chops apart: they groom dogs freehand on grooming tables, where the dog is able to move and feel comfortable rather than being strapped down or caged. It's a detail that might not matter to some owners, but dogs definitely notice.

"Dogs are happiest in a groomers when they are comfortable," the team explains. It's a philosophy that runs through everything they do — building trust and rapport with each dog, creating a warm and caring environment, and treating every visit as a relationship rather than a transaction.

## All Shapes and Sizes

From tiny terriers to gentle giants, Lovely Chops offers an inclusive grooming service that doesn't discriminate by breed or size. Whatever dog you've got, they've probably groomed one just like it — probably hundreds of times over the past decade.

## The Coverage

Based on Tangier Road in Portsmouth, Lovely Chops serves a wide area including Southsea, Hilsea, North End, Fratton and surrounding neighbourhoods. For Slough residents, it's a short drive for quality grooming from an award-recognised team.

## Modern Booking

They've recently upgraded to an online booking system through Topline Dogs, making it easy to register your dog, check availability, and secure appointments without phone tag. Deposits can be taken when needed — protection for both the business and committed customers.
