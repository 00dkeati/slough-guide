CrossFit has a reputation problem. Mention it at a dinner party and someone will inevitably bring up injuries, cult-like intensity, or that one person who won't shut up about their WOD.

Unit 22 Fitness on Waterberry Drive in Slough is different.

## Functional Fitness for Everyone

The gym offers classes seven days a week — conditioning, gymnastics, Olympic lifting, powerlifting. But it's not just for elite athletes or fitness obsessives.

Pay monthly or pay as you go. Cancel anytime. Book a free trial and see if it's for you.

## The Community Factor

What makes Unit 22 work isn't just the equipment or the programming. It's the people.

When you're struggling through that last set of burpees, having a group of people cheering you on makes all the difference. It's the reason people keep coming back.

## Classes That Actually Work

Forget the machines. Unit 22 focuses on functional movements — lifting, pulling, pushing, squatting. The kind of strength that translates to real life.

Carry your shopping bags without breaking a sweat. Pick up your kids without your back screaming. Move through life feeling capable.
