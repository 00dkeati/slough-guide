## What Customers Say

**Christine Casey** left a 5-star review:

> "We've literally just been and our 5YO son has left with the most stylish hair cut. He has additional needs and was anxious leading up to it but has never been so chilled whilst getting his hair cut. The barber and the calming music really helped relax him and, dare I say, I think he enjoyed it! He also has a double crown, so can make it hard to cut but they nailed it! Impressed and grateful - will definitely return!"
