The entrance is shared with a CrossFit gym. The parking situation is, charitably, 'challenging'. And unless you're specifically looking for it, you'd never know it exists.

All About The Grind is hiding in plain sight on Aston Road — a specialty coffee roastery that's somehow managed to attract devoted fans from across Hampshire, and even further afield.

With a 4.9-star rating from 36 reviews — nearly perfect — this isn't your average Slough café. It's a pilgrimage site for coffee obsessives.

## When Costa Just Won't Cut It

If you're the kind of person who brings an espresso machine on caravan holidays — and yes, these people exist, and yes, they review coffee shops — then you'll understand why All About The Grind has built such a devoted following.

Owner Harry roasts his own beans on-site. He can talk you through single origins from Ethiopia to Brazil, explain the difference between natural and washed processing, and help you find exactly what your palate is craving. This is proper coffee nerd territory.

## What Can You Get?

You can grab a V60, a flat white, or an espresso to drink in — there's seating, and the vibe is relaxed despite the gym next door. But most customers are here for the beans to take home.

- **Filter coffee** — Pour-over V60, single origins rotated regularly
- **Espresso drinks** — Flat whites, lattes, and straight shots
- **Beans to take home** — 250g and 1kg bags, various origins and blends
- **Subscriptions** — Regular deliveries so you never run out
- **Equipment** — Including Huskee cups and brewing gear

Prices are reasonable — especially for specialty coffee. You won't pay London prices here.

## The Personal Touch

What comes through in every review is Harry's passion. He doesn't just sell you coffee — he teaches you about it. Ask questions. Geek out. This is a safe space for caffeine enthusiasts.

## Worth the Hunt

Yes, finding the place is a bit of an adventure. Yes, you might have to circle for parking. And yes, walking into a CrossFit gym to get coffee feels weird the first time.

But if you care about what goes in your cup — properly care, not just 'I like coffee' care — this might be the best discovery you make this year.
