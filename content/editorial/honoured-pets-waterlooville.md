Here's an uncomfortable truth about the dog walking industry: almost anyone can do it.

There's no mandatory qualification. No required licence. No official oversight. Someone can decide to become a "professional dog walker" tomorrow morning and be collecting dogs by the afternoon.

Honoured Pets takes a different approach.

## Council Licenced

Honoured Pets holds Havant Council Licence No. 22292. That means they've been inspected, approved, and are operating within official guidelines.

It's not legally required. They do it anyway. Because when you're caring for someone's beloved pet, doing things properly matters.

## DBS Checked

A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check is what employers use to verify someone doesn't have a criminal record that would make them unsuitable for certain roles.

Honoured Pets is DBS checked. Again, not required for dog walking. Done anyway.

## Fully Insured

Accidents happen. Dogs are unpredictable. Having proper insurance means if something goes wrong, you're protected — and so is your pet.

## The Philosophy

"If you are like me, all of your pets have become much loved family members. When you cannot be at home for them due to work, family or other commitments, you want them taken care of with the same love and attention that you give them."

That's what Honoured Pets promises: the same love and attention you'd give them yourself.

## Reliable, Flexible, Fun

The service describes itself as "reliable, flexible, fun and friendly... with a professional approach." That balance — friendly but professional — is exactly what you want from someone caring for your pet.
