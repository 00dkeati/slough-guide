# Havant Carpet Cleaner Marks 38 Years of Five-Star Service

**A veteran carpet cleaning specialist with nearly four decades of experience continues to earn perfect review scores across multiple platforms.**

HB Cleaning Ltd, based in Havant, has been providing carpet and upholstery cleaning services since 1987. The company holds 10 out of 10 ratings on Checkatrade, Google, and Yell.

The business covers Slough, Portsmouth, Hayling, Emsworth, Petersfield, and Fareham, offering competitive prices and what customers describe as "superb results."

The company's success is built on repeat custom, with 95% of work coming from returning customers and personal recommendations.

HB Cleaning uses the Cross-American Jaguar 8.4, described as the most powerful portable extractor available in the UK. This equipment maximises soil removal whilst minimising drying times, leaving carpets only slightly damp.

The company employs eco-friendly, biodegradable chemicals from Solutions UK, which are pre-sprayed and agitated into the carpet before extraction. Any spots or stains receive individual treatment.

Services range from emergency call-outs for wine spillages to full house deep cleans for special occasions or property viewings. The business handles everything from single rooms to complete house cleans, single chairs to corner suites.

For properties with difficult access or low soiling levels, dry compound carpet cleaning and encapsulation cleaning are also available.

All work is fully insured, providing customers with complete peace of mind.
