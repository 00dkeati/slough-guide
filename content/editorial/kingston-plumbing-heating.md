Nobody wakes up excited about needing a plumber. And yet Kingston Plumbing & Heating has somehow generated 42 Google reviews — all of them five stars — from people who couldn't wait to tell others about Nik.

In an industry plagued by horror stories, that's remarkable.

## The Nik Factor

Review after review mentions Nik by name. Professional. Knowledgeable. Efficient. The kind of tradesman you tell your neighbours about.
