# Slough Carpet Cleaner Earns 270 Five-Star Reviews

**A local carpet cleaning business has become one of Hampshire's highest-rated service providers, with customers praising the "incredible" results.**

Paramount Cleaning Company, based in Slough, has accumulated more than 270 five-star Google reviews since owner Michael launched the business.

The company specialises in professional carpet and upholstery cleaning across Slough, Havant, Portsmouth, and surrounding areas, using truck-mounted steam cleaning equipment.

"Paramount is by far the best carpet cleaning service I have ever used," said one satisfied customer. "Mike was very friendly and polite and very knowledgeable. My carpets have had years of use and abuse and I was going to replace them but a friend recommended Paramount. A few days later, Mike showed up and made my carpets look like new."

The business has invested over £100,000 in professional equipment and holds advanced membership with the National Carpet Cleaners Association (NCCA), the only trade association in the industry.

Another reviewer described the transformation: "We have used Paramount twice now, and both times, the work has been incredible. They are always responsive, always reply and are always there when they say they will be. Our carpets and sofa always look brand new after they have cleaned."

Paramount offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee, promising to return free of charge if customers are not completely happy with the results.
