Getting a newborn to cooperate for photographs requires a special kind of patience. Getting them to pose beautifully in wraps, headbands, and props? That takes something more.

Kerry Potter, working from her cosy home studio in Slough, has been doing exactly that for 15 years – earning her the nickname 'The Baby Whisperer' from grateful parents.

## What Clients Say
