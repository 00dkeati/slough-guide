Your lawn is struggling. Maybe it's leather jackets. Maybe it's just years of neglect. Either way, you need someone who knows what they're doing – and who'll actually show up when they say they will.

Enter Simon from Bridges Garden Services. Based in Denmead, this local gardener has built a 4.9-star reputation across 50 Google reviews through a simple formula: excellent communication, quality work, and results that exceed expectations.

## The Transformation Specialist

Maggie McMurray's lawn had a leather jacket infestation. Not exactly a quick fix. But Simon didn't just treat the problem – he transformed the entire space.

## The Hedge That Looked Brilliant

Roger Mitchell needed his two large hedges cut back. It was high summer – sweltering temperatures that would stop most gardeners. Not Simon.

## Communication That Actually Works

12 reviews specifically mention communication. In an industry where "I'll be there Tuesday" often means "sometime next month, maybe," Simon's reliability stands out.

Lisa Simmonds has been using Bridges for her fortnightly garden maintenance: "Simon is always friendly and keen to understand what we require to be done in our garden."
