550 Google reviews. A perfect 5-star rating. Those numbers alone would make Studio H remarkable. But it's the stories behind them that explain why people drive across Hampshire to get their hair cut here.

Stories like a father whose autistic son had never been able to tolerate clippers. Stories like a 9-year-old who declared his barber 'the best I've ever had.' Stories like women walking into a traditionally male space and feeling genuinely welcomed.

## The Baggy Effect

Multiple reviews specifically name Baggy — a barber who's built a reputation for patience, especially with children and those who find haircuts difficult. He remembers what you asked for last time. He takes his time. He makes anxious kids feel safe.

## Not Just for the Lads

Barber shops can feel intimidating for women. Studio H has deliberately created a different atmosphere — one where female customers feel as welcome as anyone else.

## The Team

Beyond Baggy, barbers like Jung get consistently praised. The whole team seems to operate on the same principle: listen carefully, take your time, make it right.

## The Prices

Perhaps most surprisingly for a shop with this reputation: the prices are reasonable. One reviewer paid £32.50 for himself and his 7-year-old and called it 'hard to beat.'
