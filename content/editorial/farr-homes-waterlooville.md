Farr Homes Ltd began the way most good stories do: two people who knew what they were doing decided to do it properly.

Director Rob started as a carpenter-site manager, ran successful previous companies, and brings 17 years of personal experience in the building trade. His wife handles the operations. Together, they built their own development projects before offering that same dedication to clients.

The result? 65 Google reviews with a perfect 5.0-star rating. In an industry where complaints are common and callbacks are frequent, that's remarkable.

## What They Build

Farr Homes handles the full spectrum of residential construction: new builds, extensions, refurbishments, and loft conversions. They offer a complete 'turn-key' package, working closely with recommended architects and handling everything from design through building regulations to final furnishing.

- **New Builds:** Complete process from architect design to furnishing
- **Extensions:** Full service including design, regulations, and completion
- **Refurbishments:** Help designing and accomplishing your dream property
- **Loft Conversions:** Any size or shape, full process management

## The Reviews

What makes Farr Homes' reviews notable isn't just the rating—it's the specifics. These aren't generic 'great job' comments. They're detailed accounts of complex projects delivered well.

That phrase—'quite a complicated rebuild'—appears frequently. Farr Homes seems to attract the difficult projects, the ones other builders might walk away from.

## The Carpenter's Eye

Rob's background as a carpenter shows in the attention to detail. Multiple reviews mention the 'meticulous attention' and 'very high standard' that the team enforces on every project.

When your director started his career actually building things—rather than just managing people who build things—you get a different standard of quality control.

## The Family Business Advantage

There's something about family-run businesses that changes the dynamic. When your name is on the door, and your spouse handles the accounts, cutting corners isn't just bad business—it's personal.

Farr Homes' in-house team combines years of collective building knowledge. Projects get completed on time, on budget, and to a standard that 65 customers have rated as perfect.

## The Process

They offer to take clients around previously completed projects before work begins—letting you see real examples and get realistic costing. It's the building equivalent of 'try before you buy,' and it shows confidence in their work.

When you're trusting someone with a complicated rebuild, an extension, or your dream loft conversion, that kind of track record matters.
