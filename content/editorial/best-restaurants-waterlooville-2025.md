Slough and Horndean's restaurant scene punches well above its weight. With over 4,250 reviews analyzed across our top 10 restaurants, we've crunched the numbers, read the reviews, and eaten the food to bring you the definitive guide to where you should be spending your dining budget in 2025.

From family-friendly pubs to Indian curry houses, from Sunday roasts to fine dining, Slough has something for every occasion and budget. Here's what the data—and the diners—are saying.

## The Undisputed Champion: Four London Road

With 805 reviews and a 4.6-star rating, Four London Road isn't just Slough's most-reviewed restaurant—it's the one that consistently delivers. Located at 4 London Road, this family-friendly spot has earned its reputation the hard way: by being consistently excellent.

What makes Four London Road special? The numbers tell the story: 805 people can't be wrong. Reviewers consistently praise the delicious food, outstanding service, and family-friendly atmosphere. It's the kind of place where you can take your kids without worrying, but it's also nice enough for a date night.

The menu is varied and caters to all tastes—from classic British pub fare to more adventurous options. At mid-range pricing (£££), it offers excellent value for money.

Like any busy restaurant, Four London Road isn't perfect. Some reviewers mention waiting times during peak hours, and occasionally the service can be slower than ideal. But with 805 reviews and a 4.6-star average, the bad experiences are clearly the exception, not the rule.

## The Sunday Roast Specialist: Horse & Jockey

Located in nearby Denmead, Horse & Jockey has earned its 4.4-star rating from 738 reviews by doing one thing exceptionally well: Sunday roasts. If you're looking for the perfect Sunday lunch, this is where you should be heading.

At affordable pricing (££), Horse & Jockey offers exceptional value. The Yorkshire puddings are legendary, the portions are generous, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. It's the kind of place where families gather on Sundays and leave planning their next visit.

The only real criticism? It gets busy. Really busy. The noise levels can be high on Sundays, and you might have to wait for a table. But that's the price of popularity—and in this case, it's worth it.

## The Curry House Champion: Shalimar

With 691 reviews and a 4.4-star rating, Shalimar is Slough's go-to for Indian cuisine. This isn't just another curry house—it's a local institution that's been serving the community for years.

What sets Shalimar apart? Consistency. Night after night, they deliver the same high-quality curries, the same friendly service, and the same reliable experience. Whether you're after a quick takeaway or a sit-down meal, Shalimar delivers.

The menu is extensive, the portions are generous, and the spice levels are spot-on. It's the kind of place where regulars have their usual order, and newcomers are welcomed with the same enthusiasm.

## The All-Rounder: Number 73 Bar and Kitchen

Number 73 Bar and Kitchen at 73 London Road has earned its 4.6-star rating (419 reviews) by being excellent at everything. Sunday roasts? Check. Steaks? Check. Family meals? Check. Date nights? Check.

What makes Number 73 special is its versatility. It strikes that perfect balance—smart enough for a date night, relaxed enough for a family meal. The steaks rival restaurants charging twice the price, and the Sunday roasts have become legendary in Slough.

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the staff are friendly and efficient, and the food is consistently excellent. It's the kind of place that becomes your local favourite without you even realising it.

## The Hidden Gem: Barnard's Restaurant

With a 4.7-star rating from 201 reviews, Barnard's Restaurant might not have the volume of reviews as some of the bigger names, but it has something more valuable: a perfect reputation among those who've been.

Barnard's is Slough's fine dining option. It's where you go for special occasions, anniversaries, and those times when you want to treat yourself to something a bit special. The food is exceptional, the service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is sophisticated without being stuffy.

At higher-end pricing (££££), Barnard's isn't an everyday option for most people. But for those special occasions when you want to impress, it's worth every penny.
