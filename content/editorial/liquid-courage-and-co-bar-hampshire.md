Throwing a proper event takes work. The venue, the food, the guest list that somehow tripled since you started. But the bit that can really make or break it? The bar.

**Liquid Courage and Co** are a Hampshire-based hospitality outfit who've worked out that people want decent drinks at their events without the hassle of sourcing everything themselves.

## More Than Just Pulling Pints

Whether it's a wedding reception in a marquee, a birthday bash in the garden, or a corporate do that needs to feel less corporate, these lot bring the bar to you. Cocktails, beers, the works — served properly by people who know what they're doing.

The mobile bar setup means flexibility. Village halls, back gardens, fancy venues — if there's space for a bar, they'll make it work.

## Why It Works

Let's be honest: buying booze in bulk, hiring glasses, working out how much of what to get, then finding someone competent to actually serve it all — it's a headache. Handing the whole lot to someone who does it for a living? That's the smart move.

For anyone in the Slough or wider Hampshire area planning an event where the drinks matter, Liquid Courage and Co offer a properly professional option without the corporate catering price tag.
