There's a carpentry and building company in Portsmouth that does something unusual: when they finish a job, clients book them for the next one. And the one after that. And then an 8-bedroom HMO conversion.

Sapphire Carpentry and Building Ltd — run by George — has 30 reviews on Google. All five stars. But it's not the rating that tells the story. It's what people say after the job's done.

## The Kitchen That Made Them Come Back

Rob Deacon and his family recently had their kitchen fitted by George and the team. The review is worth reading in full, but here's the key bit:

"Nothing was too much trouble" is the phrase you want to hear from a builder. It means they solve problems instead of creating excuses.

## The Media Wall — And The Bigger Project That Followed

Ali Najfi called Sapphire Carpentry for a media wall. George assembled it "with minimal fuss and absolutely perfectly," finishing ahead of time. Then Ali had a bigger idea: garage conversion into a second living room and home office.

"Anyone who comes around to see our place comments on the finishing and quality." That's the kind of work that sells itself.

## The Bookcases Rescue Story

Abbie Pottinger had a problem. She'd booked custom alcove bookcases in January 2023. The company took a deposit. Then let her down three times. Took months to return the deposit. By August, she was stressed and starting over.

George contacted her straight away. Knew exactly what she wanted. Designed it. Answered all her questions. Then — knowing the job would only take 1-2 days — squeezed her in within a few weeks.

"He worked incredibly hard asking if I was happy as he was doing the project" — that's someone who cares about the result, not just the invoice.

## The Property Developer Who Keeps Coming Back

Joel Walker is a property developer. He's worked with "many builders over the years." He's now booked Sapphire Carpentry for multiple large projects, including an 8-bedroom HMO conversion. Here's why:

"Runs a tight ship." "Reliable project management." "Taken lots of stress off me." That's a developer who's found someone he can trust with big budgets and tight deadlines.

## The Media Wall That Got Everyone Talking

Annette Bickle called for a quote. George came round. Offered his knowledge on what might look best. Clear communication throughout the build. Team arrived on time every day. Clean and tidy. Even accommodated extra work with no fuss.

"I felt very comfortable I had made the correct choice" is what good communication gets you. No surprises. No stress.

## The Numbers

## What Makes Them Different

George doesn't just turn up and do the work. He offers knowledge. He designs. He communicates. He runs a tight ship. And when he's done, people come back for the next job.

That's not luck. That's a business model.
