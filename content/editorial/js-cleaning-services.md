There's a window cleaner in Slough who'll spend 7 days jet-washing an entire estate if that's what it takes. Who makes rendering look like it did years ago, before the elements took their toll. Who never lets customers down.

J's Cleaning Services is run by Jamie, and if you ask the Oak Tree Drive Management Company Ltd, he's accomplished his work 'with professionalism and efficiency and to an outstanding level of finish.'

## The Estate Job That Impressed Everyone

When an entire estate needs cleaning—roadways, driveways, and patios—you need someone who can handle it. Jamie spent 7 days on one estate job, and the directors of the management company were so impressed they recommended him 'without reservation.'

## Before and After Results

One customer attached before and after pictures of their rendering: 'Didn't realise how bad it truly was.' The workmanship? 'Incredible.' Jamie cleaned years of colour damage from the elements, jet-washed patios and garden walls, and cleaned guttering—all to an impressive standard.

## Years of Reliable Service

Jamie's built a reputation for reliability. One customer says he's done their windows for years and 'never let us down.' When they needed the roof and gutters cleaned too, everything looked 'like new.'
