All Weather Walkies operates as a five-star licensed dog daycare, home boarding, and walking service across Bedhampton, Havant, and Slough. The business distinguishes itself through comprehensive professional qualifications and a safety-first approach to pet care.

The operator holds a City & Guilds National Certificate in Animal Care Level 2, a Level 3 Ofqual Certificate in Professional Daycare and Boarding, and a Level 4 Reactivity Specialist certification from the Dog Training College. Advanced canine first aid training and Pet Business Insurance provide additional assurance for clients.

The business was nominated for the Havant Constituency Small Business & Community Awards 2024, recognising its contribution to local pet care services.

All potential daycare and boarding clients must complete a trial period before regular bookings. Trial daycare runs from 8am to 6pm for £30, whilst trial overnight stays cost £40. This mandatory assessment ensures dogs settle comfortably and the service can meet their individual needs. The operators make clear they will decline dogs who appear stressed or uncomfortable, prioritising animal welfare over commercial considerations.

Services include daily dog walking, full daycare, and overnight boarding in a licensed home environment. The "all weather" commitment means walks proceed regardless of conditions, providing consistency for dogs with high exercise needs.

For Slough residents requiring flexible pet care with professional credentials, All Weather Walkies offers a fully licensed alternative to traditional kennels, with the added benefit of home-based care and qualified handlers.
