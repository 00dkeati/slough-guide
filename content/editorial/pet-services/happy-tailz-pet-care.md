**Contact:** 07864 651142  
**Location:** Slough and surrounding areas  
**Service Type:** Comprehensive pet care services

Happy Tailz Pet Care Services delivers professional animal care across Slough, operating with the philosophy that contented, well-exercised pets make for happier households. The business name reflects this commitment to animal welfare and customer satisfaction.

Services extend beyond basic dog walking to encompass a full spectrum of pet care support. Dog walking includes individual and group sessions, whilst pet sitting provides in-home care for various animal types during owner absences. Home visits for feeding, health checks, and companionship cater to cats, small animals, and pets who experience stress when transported to unfamiliar locations.

The business understands that pet care requirements vary significantly between households. Working professionals may require daily walking at consistent times, whilst elderly pet owners might need occasional assistance during medical appointments or family visits. Happy Tailz accommodates both regular schedules and ad-hoc bookings, providing flexibility without compromising service quality.

Local knowledge of Slough's parks, woodland areas, and safe walking routes informs walk planning. The operator selects appropriate environments based on dog temperament, size, and exercise needs – energetic breeds receive challenging routes with varied terrain, whilst smaller or elderly dogs enjoy shorter, gentler walks on level ground.

Professional insurance and appropriate risk assessments provide peace of mind for clients concerned about their pet's safety during care. The mobile contact method ensures direct communication for booking arrangements, schedule changes, or discussions about individual pet requirements.

For Slough households seeking reliable, professional pet care with genuine commitment to animal welfare, Happy Tailz Pet Care Services offers comprehensive support from an experienced local operator.
