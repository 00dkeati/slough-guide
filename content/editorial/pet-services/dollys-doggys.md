# Dolly's Doggys - Local Dog Care Services in Slough

**Contact:** 07852 209638  
**Location:** Slough and surrounding areas  
**Service Type:** Dog walking and pet sitting

Dolly's Doggys provides dog-focused care services to Slough households, combining professional standards with the personal touch characteristic of small, independent operators. The business serves working professionals, elderly pet owners, and anyone requiring reliable support with their dog's exercise and care needs.

Daily walks form the core service, with routes selected according to individual dog requirements. The Slough area offers diverse environments – from structured park walks on designated paths to more adventurous woodland routes for dogs who enjoy exploring natural terrain. This variety prevents the monotony that can affect dogs walked repeatedly in identical locations.

The service accommodates both regular weekly schedules and occasional bookings for holiday cover or emergency situations. This flexibility proves valuable for clients whose work patterns vary or who require temporary support during illness or family commitments.

Pet sitting services allow dogs to remain in familiar home environments rather than kennels or daycare facilities. This approach suits anxious animals, elderly dogs with established routines, and those requiring medication administration at specific times. Home-based care reduces stress and maintains normal eating and sleeping patterns.

The mobile contact number facilitates direct communication with the dog walker, enabling quick responses to booking queries and last-minute schedule changes. This accessibility contrasts with larger franchises where client communication often routes through central offices with less personal knowledge of individual dogs.

For Slough residents seeking straightforward, reliable dog care without corporate complications, Dolly's Doggys offers local expertise and personal service.
