**Location:** Slough area  
**Service Type:** Professional dog walking and pet care

Walkabout Paws provides professional dog walking services to the Slough community, offering regular exercise and companionship for dogs whose owners face time constraints or mobility limitations.

The business operates on a professional basis with appropriate insurance and local knowledge of suitable walking locations around Slough. Routes include local parks, woodland areas, and quieter residential streets depending on individual dog temperaments and weather conditions.

The service caters to various client needs, from daily walks for working pet owners to occasional cover during holidays or illness. This flexibility makes Walkabout Paws a practical option for households with unpredictable schedules who still want consistency in their dog's routine.

Solo walks suit dogs who prefer individual attention or have specific behavioural considerations, whilst group walks provide socialisation opportunities for dogs who enjoy canine company. The walker assesses each dog's suitability for group walks during initial meetings, ensuring compatible temperaments are grouped together.

Regular clients benefit from building a relationship between their dog and the walker, reducing stress associated with care from unfamiliar people. The mobile contact number allows direct communication for booking changes or to discuss any concerns about a dog's behaviour or health.

For Slough residents seeking reliable local dog walking without corporate overheads, Walkabout Paws offers personal service backed by professional standards.
