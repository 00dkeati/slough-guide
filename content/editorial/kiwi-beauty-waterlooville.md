Kiwi Beauty operates from Upper Bere Wood — not exactly the glittering heart of Slough's beauty scene. And yet Hayley has managed something remarkable: 58 Google reviews without a single one dropping below five stars.

A perfect score. In an industry where one bad eyebrow can spawn a scathing review, that's genuinely impressive.

## What Does Kiwi Beauty Offer?

Hayley runs the full range of beauty treatments, but specialises in a few key areas that keep clients coming back — and travelling considerable distances to do so.

*Professional beauty treatments at Kiwi Beauty*

- **Brow lamination** — The treatment she's known for, with consistent results
- **Lash lifts and tints** — 'Definitely the best one I've had to date'
- **Skin tag removal** — Quick, professional, minimal fuss
- **Training courses** — She teaches other beauticians too
- **General beauty treatments** — Facials, waxing, the full range

## Not Just a Salon — A Training Academy

What sets Kiwi Beauty apart is that Hayley doesn't just do treatments — she teaches them. Beauty therapists come to her to learn new skills, and they leave confident enough to offer them to their own clients.

## The Family Factor

What comes through in review after review isn't just skill — it's warmth. Clients don't just come back; they bring their families. That says something.

## Worth the Trip

If you're local, Kiwi Beauty is an obvious choice. If you're not — well, people are literally driving over an hour to get here. When 58 people agree on a perfect score, it's worth paying attention.
