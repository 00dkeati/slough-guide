# Slough Oven Cleaner Offers One-Stop Cleaning Solution

**A local cleaning company based in Slough is winning praise for its professional service and competitive prices across oven, carpet and end-of-tenancy cleans.**

Ovens N More Cleaning Services, run by Aaron, has been operating around Hampshire and West Sussex for ten years, providing what customers describe as an "excellent" service.

"Brilliant Aaron, your service is excellent. Thoroughly recommend using this company. My oven has never been so clean - imagine having to do that every day!! Carpets great too," wrote one delighted customer.

The company offers a comprehensive range of services from its base in Slough. Single ovens start from £60, with double ovens at £80 including racks. Hobs, extractors and microwaves can be added on, with range cookers also catered for.

Beyond ovens, Ovens N More provides carpet cleaning from £50 per room and full end-of-tenancy cleans from £200 for one-bedroom properties.

"Recently used Ovens N More Cleaning Services to clean carpets, oven, microwave, hob and hood for end of tenancy. Aaron arrived on time and is such a friendly guy - would definitely use again and have already recommended to a friend," reported another satisfied customer.

The company uses a specialist dip tank system for deep cleaning, dismantling ovens where possible to reach even the toughest burnt-on grease and carbon deposits.

Aaron is known for fitting customers in quickly and for his friendly, professional approach. Flea treatment services are also available.
