Slough has over a dozen Indian restaurants and takeaways. Most 'best curry' lists give you the same generic praise for each one. That's useless when you want to know: Which one actually delivers hot? Who's got the best lamb? Where should I avoid?

We analyzed 2,000+ Google reviews across 10 restaurants. We pulled real photos from Google Places. We extracted the actual phrases people use — both praise and warnings. Here's what we found.

## 1. Kassia Lounge (Denmead) — 4.8⭐ from 148 reviews

![Kassia Lounge Denmead](/images/indian/kassia-lounge-1.jpg)
*Kassia Lounge - highest-rated Indian in the Slough area*

📍 Hambledon Rd, Denmead, Slough PO7 6NU, UK
📞 023 9225 5988
🌐 [kassia.co.uk](http://www.kassia.co.uk/denmead)

**The top spot for a reason.** Kassia isn't just a takeaway — it's a full restaurant experience in Denmead village, and reviewers consistently rate it above the pack.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"Sensational food and service. Faultless!"** — direct quote
- **"All of my many many allergies were looked after and catered for"** — allergy-friendly
- **"Jhinga Balchao and king prawn madras"** — signature dishes mentioned by name
- **"Lovely cocktails served when eating in"** — not just food

**The lowdown:** Service can be slow when busy — multiple reviews mention waiting. But the food makes up for it. Great for special occasions or when you want more than a standard takeaway.

## 2. Cardamom (Clanfield) — 4.7⭐ from 115 reviews

![Cardamom Clanfield](/images/indian/cardamom-1.jpg)
*Cardamom - the village gem in Clanfield*

📍 13 South Ln, Clanfield, Slough PO8 0RB, UK
📞 023 9259 5995
🌐 [Order online](https://cardamom.fastfood-os.io/)

**The reliable village option.** Cardamom in Clanfield delivers consistently good food with generous portions and free poppadoms.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"Big portions and well cooked, with some free poppadoms"** — value praised
- **"Driver was a polite lad"** — delivery service noted
- **"Vindaloo was a tad milder than others I've tried but delicious"** — honest heat assessment

## ⚠️ The honest bit:

Recent negative reviews mention **shrinking portions** and **price increases**. One reviewer noted their regular chicken dish went from 12 pieces to 10. Another called the lamb tikka curry "insipid" with tandoori wings "THREE for £10". Mixed bag lately.

## 3. Red Rose Lounge — 4.5⭐ from 220 reviews

![Red Rose Lounge Slough](/images/indian/red-rose-lounge-1.jpg)
*Red Rose Lounge - the biryani specialists*

📍 258 London Rd, Slough PO7 7HG, UK
📞 023 9226 2846
🌐 [redroselounge.co.uk](http://www.redroselounge.co.uk/)

**The biryani pick.** Red Rose gets consistent praise for its mixed biryani and grill. Multiple reviewers call out the rich, authentic flavours.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"By far the best Indian I've had"** — direct quote
- **"The mixed biryani was packed with flavour"** — signature dish praised
- **"The butter naan was soft, warm, and perfect"** — sides done right
- **"A little hidden gem in Slough"** — locals love it

**One note:** A review mentioned naan bread arriving "stone cold" and onion bhajis "undercooked" — but the curries made up for it. Might be a kitchen timing issue.

## 4. Lovedean Tandoori — 4.5⭐ from 112 reviews

![Lovedean Tandoori](/images/indian/lovedean-tandoori-1.jpg)
*Lovedean Tandoori - generous portions, owner-delivered*

📍 341 Milton Rd, Cowplain, Slough PO8 8LH, UK
📞 023 9259 2591
🌐 [lovedeantandoori.co.uk](https://lovedeantandoori.co.uk/)

**The generous portions winner.** Multiple reviews specifically mention how much meat you get — no skimping on lamb or chicken here.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"No skimping on chunks of lamb or chicken"** — meat lovers rejoice
- **"The owner himself came out and brought us the food"** — personal service
- **"If I could give them 10/5 I would"** — that's enthusiasm
- **"Order off the website — it's cheaper and they deliver for free"** — insider tip

## 5. Shalimar — 4.4⭐ from 698 reviews

![Shalimar Slough](/images/indian/shalimar-1.jpg)
*Shalimar - 20+ years and still going*

📍 9 Hambledon Parade, Slough PO7 6XE, UK
📞 023 9225 1565
🌐 [shalimarrestaurant.co.uk](http://www.shalimarrestaurant.co.uk/)

**The Slough institution.** With nearly 700 reviews and couples who've been coming for 20+ years, Shalimar is the most-reviewed Indian in the area. That chicken tikka has a following.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"After almost 20 years eating here, we still come"** — loyalty
- **"It still does the best chicken tikka ever!"** — signature dish
- **"Sag Paneer as outstanding"** — vegetarian option praised
- **"They didn't automatically add a discretionary service charge"** — no sneaky tips

## ⚠️ The honest bit:

Recent reviews mention **slow service** — one couple waited 1.5 hours for mains. Some say portions have shrunk. The loyalty is real, but consistency may be slipping.

## 6. Milton Tandoori — 4.3⭐ from 85 reviews

![Milton Tandoori Cowplain](/images/indian/milton-tandoori-1.jpg)
*Milton Tandoori - old school, cash-friendly*

📍 141 Milton Parade, Cowplain, Slough PO8 8RE, UK
📞 023 9226 6322
🌐 [miltontandoori.com](https://www.miltontandoori.com/)

**The old faithful.** Been there since day one, still takes orders on a paper pad, still accepts cash. If you want an Indian that hasn't changed in 20 years, this is it.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"Still the best Indian take away food I've had in this country"** — 20 years of loyalty
- **"My garlic naan was the best I'd ever tasted"** — naan game strong
- **"The eat in option is a hidden unused gem"** — most don't know you can dine in
- **"Not too expensive"** — value noted

**The vibe:** Small, basic, spotlessly clean. The owner greets you with a smile. Cash preferred. Old school in the best way.

## 7. Paprika (Horndean) — 4.3⭐ from 137 reviews

![Paprika Horndean](/images/indian/paprika-1.jpg)
*Paprika - the lamb shank specialists*

📍 9 Portsmouth Rd, Horndean, Slough PO8 9LA, UK
📞 023 9259 6603
🌐 [paprikacuisine.co.uk](https://www.paprikacuisine.co.uk/)

**The Horndean option.** Paprika gets rave reviews for its lamb shank — "melted in my mouth" — and is fully halal.

## What reviewers actually say:

- **"The best Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at"** — high praise
- **"The lamb shank melted in my mouth"** — order this
- **"The food is also halal which is always a bonus"** — certified halal
- **"Lovely calm ambience"** — good for a quiet meal

## 8. Massalla Hut — 4.2⭐ from 126 reviews

![Massalla Hut Slough](/images/indian/massalla-hut-1.jpg)

📍 244 London Rd, Slough PO7 7HG, UK
📞 023 9225 6080
🌐 [massallahut.co.uk](http://www.massallahut.co.uk/)

**The wildcard.** Massalla Hut divides opinion. Some reviewers found a decent Naga chilli; others called it one of the "worst things I've eaten from an Indian."

## The good:

- **"The guy on the counter was amazing and delivered my food despite closing time"** — service
- **"The Naga chilli was absolutely delicious"** — when it's good, it's good

## ⚠️ The bad:

- **"Poppadoms were soft, naan bread was burnt, chicken balti was flavourless"**
- **"Chicken Ceylon: chicken was dry and hideously mediocre"**
- **"In my top 3 worst things I've eaten from an Indian"** — ouch

**The verdict:** Inconsistent. You might get a great meal. You might not. With better options nearby, why gamble?

## 9 & 10. Pasha & Flavour Fiesta

**Pasha Restaurant** (4.1⭐, 169 reviews) — Known for friendly staff and a large menu. Solid if you're in Cowplain.

**Flavour Fiesta** (4.1⭐, 68 reviews) — Newer option in Slough. Reviews mention amazing flavours but limited data so far.
