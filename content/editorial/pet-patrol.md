**Contact:** 07736 472136 **Location:** Slough and surrounding areas **Service Type:** Pet care and dog walking

Pet Patrol operates across Slough providing pet care services that extend beyond standard dog walking. The business caters to various pet care needs, offering flexibility for clients with multiple requirements or unusual schedules.

Services typically include daily dog walks, home visits for feeding and companionship, and pet sitting for clients away from home. This range makes Pet Patrol suitable for households with multiple pets or those requiring care beyond basic walking services.

The local focus means the operator understands Slough's geography, identifying safe walking routes and suitable exercise locations for different dog sizes and energy levels. Knowledge of local veterinary services and pet-friendly facilities provides additional reassurance for clients concerned about emergency situations.

Home visit services suit cats, small animals, and elderly dogs who benefit from remaining in familiar surroundings rather than travelling to daycare facilities. Medication administration and specific feeding schedules can typically be accommodated with advance notice.

The mobile contact number facilitates direct communication between clients and the service provider, avoiding the delays common with businesses using centralised booking systems or email-only contact methods. This proves particularly valuable for last-minute changes or emergency cover requirements.

For Slough residents seeking versatile pet care from a local operator who understands the area, Pet Patrol offers practical services without corporate complexity.
