Ask any homeowner what frustrates them about tradespeople, and "the mess they leave" usually ranks high on the list.

Coastal Electrical Installations has clearly heard that feedback. Time and again, their reviews mention the same thing: they tidy up.

## The Small Things That Matter

It sounds obvious. But it's mentioned because it's not universal. When an electrician leaves your home as clean as they found it, you remember.

## Round-the-Clock Availability

Based on Chatsworth Avenue in Cosham, Coastal Electrical operates 24 hours a day. Whether you need planned work or an emergency callout, they're available.

## Nine and Counting

Nine reviews, all five stars. For a company that operates round the clock - when tired crews and difficult hours could easily lead to slipping standards - that's impressive.
