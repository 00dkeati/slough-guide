Valentine's Day falls on a Friday this year, which means you've got no excuse not to plan something special. Whether you're looking for fine dining, a cosy pub meal, or something a bit different, Slough has more romantic options than you might expect.

We've done the research — analysed the reviews, checked the menus, and found the spots that'll make your Valentine feel special without having to trek into Portsmouth or Southampton.

## 🍷 Best Romantic Restaurants in Slough

### 1. Barnard's Restaurant — The Fine Dining Choice

*Barnard's Restaurant - elegant fine dining in Horndean*

📍 1 Barnard's Way, Horndean PO8 0HU
⭐ 4.7/5 (201 reviews)
💰 ££££

If you want to properly impress, **Barnard's is Slough's most romantic restaurant**. It's the kind of place where they remember your name, the food is exquisite, and the atmosphere is intimate without being stuffy.

The menu changes seasonally, but expect beautifully presented dishes with local ingredients. Reviewers consistently mention the "special occasion" feel — this isn't somewhere you pop in for a quick meal; it's somewhere you *experience*.

**Book now.** Seriously. Valentine's tables here go fast.

### 2. Four London Road — The Reliable Favourite

*Four London Road - over 800 glowing reviews*

📍 4 London Road, Horndean PO8 0BZ
⭐ 4.6/5 (805 reviews)
💰 £££

With over 800 five-star reviews, Four London Road has earned its spot as Slough's most-loved restaurant. It strikes that rare balance — special enough for Valentine's, but not so formal that you can't relax.

The menu has something for everyone, the wine list is solid, and the service is consistently excellent. If your partner isn't into fine dining fuss, this is the perfect middle ground.

**Pro tip:** Ask for a table away from the main door for a quieter evening.

### 3. Number 73 Bar and Kitchen — The Steakhouse Option

![Number 73 Bar and Kitchen](/images/restaurants/number-73-bar-and-kitchen.jpg)
*Number 73 - steaks that rival restaurants charging twice the price*

📍 73 London Road, Slough PO7 7EY
⭐ 4.6/5 (419 reviews)
💰 £££

If your Valentine loves a good steak, Number 73 delivers. Their steaks rival restaurants charging twice the price, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming — think exposed brick, soft lighting, and a proper cocktail menu.

The Sunday roasts are legendary, but on Valentine's night, it's all about the à la carte. The fillet is the standout, and the staff know their wines.

### 4. DARBAR — The Romantic Indian

📍 20-21 The Precinct, Slough PO7 7DT
⭐ 4.3/5 
💰 ££

OpenTable reviewers describe DARBAR as having a "quiet ambience for dinner" and being a "perfect restaurant for a special occasion." It's not your typical high-street curry house — the décor is elegant, the portions are refined, and there's genuine care in the cooking.

If your idea of romance is sharing a lamb biryani by candlelight, this is your spot.

### 5. The Chairmakers Arms — The Countryside Escape

![The Chairmakers Arms](/images/editorial/chairmakers-arms.jpg)
*The Chairmakers - a countryside escape worth the drive*

📍 Oakshott Ln, Hawkley GU33 6LB
⭐ 4.5/5 (612 reviews)
💰 £££

A 15-minute drive from Slough, but worth every mile. The Chairmakers is a proper country pub with roaring fires, excellent food, and the kind of cosy atmosphere that makes you want to stay all evening.

Not technically Slough, but perfect for couples who want to escape the town centre and feel like they've gone on a mini adventure.

## 🥂 Romantic Bars & Pubs for Drinks

Don't want a full meal? These spots are perfect for cocktails, wine, or a cosy pint by the fire.

### The Bird in Hand

📍 269 Lovedean Ln, Slough PO8 9RX
⭐ 4.3/5 (1,197 reviews)

Classic country pub with a massive garden and a genuinely romantic feel on winter evenings. Log fires, real ales, and that proper village pub atmosphere. Perfect for a post-walk drink.

### The Exchange

![The Exchange bar](/images/pubs/the-exchange-1.jpg)
*The Exchange - modern cocktails in a relaxed setting*

📍 Wellington Way, Slough PO7 7EY
⭐ 4.2/5

More modern than the traditional pubs, The Exchange has a decent cocktail menu and a relaxed atmosphere. Good for couples who prefer a contemporary vibe over country-pub cosiness.

## 🌳 Romantic Date Ideas Beyond Dinner

### Sunset Walk at Portsdown Hill

![Portsdown Hill views](/images/editorial/portsdown-hill.jpg)
*Portsdown Hill - stunning sunset views over Portsmouth*

Free, beautiful, and only 10 minutes from Slough. Time your visit for sunset (around 5pm in February) and watch the lights of Portsmouth flicker on below. Bring a flask of something warm.

### Queen Elizabeth Country Park

If you're both outdoorsy types, a winter walk through QECP is genuinely romantic. 1,400 acres of forest, quieter than summer, and plenty of cosy spots. Finish with hot chocolate at the visitor centre café.

### The Bat & Ball, Hambledon

📍 Hyden Farm Ln, Hambledon PO7 4RU

Combine a countryside walk with a pint at the "birthplace of cricket." Historic pub, lovely setting, and proper pub food. About 15 minutes from Slough.
