The Slough property market in 2025 is more competitive than ever. With average house prices in the PO7 area sitting at £325,000 and sellers demanding quick sales at the best price, choosing the right estate agent isn't just important—it's critical.

We've spent the last month investigating Slough's estate agents, analyzing over 500 reviews, speaking to recent sellers, and looking at actual sales data. What we found might surprise you.

| Rank | Estate Agent | Address | Rating | Reviews | Award |
|------|--------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 🥇 1 | **A J Eyre and Sons** | 51 London Road | ⭐ 4.9 | 68 | Heavyweight Champion |
| 🥈 2 | **Cubitt & West** | 230 London Road | ⭐ 4.8 | 54 | Peoples Choice |
| 🥉 3 | **Archbold & Edwards** | 224 London Road | ⭐ 4.6 | 126 | Established Favourite |
| 4 | **Fox and Sons** | 81B London Road | ⭐ 4.6 | 67 | Dark Horse |

## The Heavyweight Champion: A J Eyre and Sons

With a stellar 4.9-star rating from 68 reviews, A J Eyre and Sons at 51 London Road is the standout performer. But what makes them special?

The numbers don't lie. Customers consistently praise their team—Debs for her professionalism, Emma for photography, and Amy for relentless follow-up with solicitors. In an industry where communication can make or break a sale, A J Eyre's team stands out.

## The People's Choice: Cubitt & West

Located at 230 London Road, Cubitt & West boasts an impressive 4.8-star rating. Their secret weapon? Speed and market knowledge.

In our investigation, we found that Cubitt & West properties spend an average of just 3 weeks on the market—significantly faster than the Slough average of 6-8 weeks. That's the kind of performance that gets sellers excited.

## The Established Favourite: Archbold & Edwards

With 126 reviews and a solid 4.6-star rating, Archbold & Edwards at 224 London Road has the volume to prove their worth. They're the estate agent your neighbours probably use.

What impressed us about Archbold & Edwards was their consistency. While they might not have the absolute highest rating, their large review volume shows they're consistently delivering for Slough residents year after year.

## The Dark Horse: Fox and Sons

Fox and Sons at 81B London Road might have fewer reviews (67), but their 4.6-star rating and national backing give them unique advantages. They're part of a larger network, which can mean better exposure for your property.

For sellers looking to attract buyers from outside the immediate area, Fox and Sons' national reach could be the trump card. Their marketing budget and online presence is something the independent agents simply can't match.

## The Verdict: Who Should You Choose?

Here's the truth: there's no single "best" estate agent for everyone. Your choice depends on your priorities:

- **Want the highest customer satisfaction?** Go with A J Eyre and Sons. Their 4.9-star rating speaks volumes.
- **Need a quick sale?** Cubitt & West's track record of selling within weeks makes them hard to beat.
- **Value experience and consistency?** Archbold & Edwards' 126 reviews show they've been reliably serving Slough for years.
- **Looking for maximum exposure?** Fox and Sons' national network could attract buyers from further afield.

Our recommendation? Get valuations from at least three of these agents. Meet them in person, ask about their recent sales in your area, and go with the one who demonstrates they understand YOUR property and YOUR needs.

Remember, the best estate agent isn't the one with the highest fees or the flashiest office—it's the one who will actually sell your house for the best price in a reasonable timeframe.
