Corporate headshots have a reputation problem. They're often stiff, awkward, and make perfectly normal people look like they're being held hostage by HR.

Ali Gaudion at Hotheadshot, based in Emsworth, has spent 20 years solving this problem. Her secret weapon? A degree in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania combined with decades as a professional photographer.

## The Difference

Ali's speciality is 'hot' headshots that not only show people in their best light but also reflect their business brand and ethos. These aren't generic corporate photos – they're professional portraits that capture personality.

## Services

- **Business headshots** – individual executives and professionals
- **Team photography** – groups from 1 to 100+ staff
- **Mobile studio service** – she comes to your office
- **Workspace photography** – clean, contemporary documentation
- **Corporate events** – professional event coverage
- **Product and service photography**

## Why It Works

That psychology degree isn't just a credential – it's the foundation of Ali's people skills. She understands what makes people tense up in front of cameras and, more importantly, how to help them relax and look natural.

Her weekend experience as a wedding photographer adds another dimension: the ability to capture style, atmosphere, and genuine moments even in corporate settings.
