Not every dog bounces into a grooming salon, tail wagging, ready for their pamper session. Some dogs are nervous. Some are rescue animals with unknown histories. Some just need a gentler approach than the average groomer provides.

Doggilocks Natural Grooming in Wickham has carved out a niche doing exactly this — specialising in poodles, poodle crosses, puppies, rescue pets, and anxious animals who need extra care and patience.

## The Natural Approach

The "Natural" in the name isn't marketing fluff. Doggilocks uses PAW NATUREL products exclusively — 100% natural formulas that are:

- **Puppy friendly** — gentle enough for the youngest dogs
- **Tear free** — no stinging eyes during bath time
- **Cruelty free** — tested on humans first
- **Vegan friendly** — no animal-derived ingredients
- **Free from nasties** — no sulphates (SLES/SLS), parabens, or alcohol

For dogs with sensitive skin, allergies, or owners who care about what goes on their pet's coat, this matters. Standard grooming products can be harsh; these aren't.

## Lisa's Touch

The reviews consistently mention Lisa, the groomer, and her patient, kind, dedicated approach. "It was my dog's first groom and I felt very happy leaving him in her capable hands," writes one customer. "He looked great and smelled so good!"

Another adds: "Took my toy Maltipoo today for full groom. Lisa was excellent, patient, kind & very dedicated with him. Will definitely visit regularly now."

For nervous dogs, that patience is everything. Rushing a stressed animal never ends well — and Lisa clearly understands that.

## One-to-One Care

Every pet gets individual attention. No production line grooming, no dogs waiting in cages while others are processed. Just your pet and their groomer, taking the time needed to do the job properly without stress.

## Cats Welcome Too

It's not just dogs — Doggilocks also handles cats, including nail clipping for felines whose usual vets can't fit them in. One cat owner reported their pet was "so calm" after the session — not something you often hear about cats at the groomers.
