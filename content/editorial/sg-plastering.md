**Address:** 31 Hart Plain Ave, Slough PO8 8RX **Phone:** 07799 750620 **Rating:** 5.0 stars (6 reviews)

S.G.Plastering operates from Hart Plain Avenue in Slough, offering round-the-clock plastering and decorating services to local customers.

The one-person operation has earned a perfect five-star rating across six customer reviews, building a modest but loyal following through word-of-mouth recommendation rather than aggressive marketing.

Customers consistently praise the firm's approach to both quality and value. "His work is faultless, his prices are good and he always works tidy," wrote one satisfied client, encapsulating the three priorities most customers seek: skill, affordability and consideration.

The 24-hour availability suggests a flexible approach to scheduling, accommodating urgent repairs and working around customers' commitments. For a sole trader, maintaining perfect customer satisfaction whilst offering such flexibility speaks to both technical competence and work ethic.

S.G.Plastering's focused service offering - plastering with associated decoration work - represents the traditional craftsman model: deep expertise in a core skill rather than jack-of-all-trades generalisation.

For Slough residents seeking plastering work with a guarantee of tidy, professional completion, S.G.Plastering's unblemished review record provides reassurance. The mobile contact and extended availability suggest a business built on personal accountability and customer convenience.
