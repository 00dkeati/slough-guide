Most wedding photographers get nervous when a professional photographer is among the guests. Simon at South Coast Pictures? He earned the ultimate endorsement.

## The B.R.I.D.E Strategy

Simon has developed what he calls the 'B.R.I.D.E' strategy – a unique approach to helping anxious couples create natural wedding memories beyond what they believe possible. It removes the stress and uncertainty that many people feel about having their photo taken.

The result? Couples who thought they'd hate being photographed end up loving their images.

## What Couples Say
