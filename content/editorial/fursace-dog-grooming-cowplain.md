There's a particular kind of dog owner who cringes at the thought of dropping their beloved pooch into a busy grooming salon — the kind where multiple dogs bark in cages, waiting their turn, while stressed groomers work against the clock.

Fursace on London Road in Cowplain operates differently. One dog. One groomer. One appointment at a time.

## The One-to-One Difference

"Stress-free and enjoyable" isn't just marketing speak here — it's the entire business model. When your dog arrives at Fursace, they're the only client in the building. No distractions. No anxiety-inducing barking from the next cage over. Just focused attention from an experienced professional groomer.

For nervous dogs, reactive dogs, or just dogs who appreciate a bit of personal space, this makes all the difference.

## What They Offer

The full grooming menu covers everything your dog might need:

- **Baths** — Because sometimes a hose in the garden just won't cut it
- **Haircuts** — Breed-specific or owner-preferred styles
- **Nail trimming** — The bit most owners dread doing themselves
- **Ear cleaning** — Often overlooked, always important
- **De-matting** — When things have gotten a bit out of hand (additional fee applies)

What's refreshing is the transparency. The booking policy clearly states de-matting fees (£10-25 depending on severity), and if the matting is too severe to save, they'll shave short rather than put the dog through unnecessary discomfort. It's care that prioritises the animal over aesthetics.

## Professional Standards

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 gets a specific mention in their policies — a sign this isn't someone who watched a few YouTube tutorials and bought some clippers. The groomer behind Fursace takes the profession seriously, including the uncomfortable conversations about what happens when coats have been neglected too long.

## Booking and Practicalities

Appointments require a 45% deposit to confirm — reasonable protection against no-shows, which plague the grooming industry. Cancellations need 72 hours notice, and there's a lateness policy (£5 per 5 minutes after the first 5, full charge after 15).

One request: make sure your dog has been to the toilet before arriving. Fair enough.
