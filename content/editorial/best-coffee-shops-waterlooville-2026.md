Slough's café scene has quietly levelled up. Gone are the days when Costa was your only option — the town now has a solid mix of independent coffee shops, brunch spots, and cosy tea rooms. Here's where to get your caffeine fix.

## ☕ Top Picks for Coffee in Slough

**Coffee quality:** 4/5
**Atmosphere:** 4/5

## 2. The Coffee House at Tesco — Hidden Gem
