There's something appealing about beauty treatments that happen somewhere other than a busy high street. No parking stress. No background noise from the shop next door. No strangers in the waiting area.

Kerry Kynvin Beauty operates from a purpose-built therapy cabin in Cowplain — a dedicated space designed specifically for relaxation and treatment. It's the kind of setup that makes you wonder why more therapists don't do the same.

## The Microblading Specialist

While Kerry offers a full range of beauty treatments, her specialty is microblading — the semi-permanent eyebrow technique that's transformed countless thin, patchy, or overplucked brows into the full, natural-looking arches people actually want.

It's a skill that requires serious training and a steady hand. Done well, microblading can save twenty minutes of makeup time every morning for up to two years. Done badly... well, that's why you want someone experienced.

Kerry also offers individual and volume lash extensions for those who want their eyes to do the talking without daily mascara battles.

## Beyond the Brows

The treatment menu covers classic beauty essentials:

- **Massage** — Swedish and hot stone options for proper tension release
- **Facials** — Using ELEMIS products (the premium skincare brand favoured by high-end spas)
- **Nails** — Gel polish manicures and pedicures
- **Brow shaping** — Threading and waxing
- **Facial waxing** — For everything else

The ELEMIS facials are worth highlighting. It's a product range that many salons can't afford to stock, let alone build treatments around.

## The Setup

The therapy cabin isn't an afterthought or a converted shed — it's a proper treatment space, designed with client comfort in mind. Privacy is built in. The environment is controlled. And when your appointment is finished, you can slip back to your car without navigating a shopping centre.

For clients who find busy salons overwhelming, or who simply prefer a more personal experience, this setup makes all the difference.
