There's a particular skill in being everywhere at a wedding while appearing to be nowhere. It's the difference between posed, uncomfortable photographs and those magical candid shots that make you laugh or cry years later.

James White, working from his Bedhampton studio in Havant, has mastered this art. With over 120 reviews across platforms and a 96% recommendation rate on Facebook, he's become one of the most sought-after wedding photographers on the south coast.

## The Reviews Speak for Themselves

What sets James apart isn't just technical skill – it's his ability to make couples feel at ease on what's often a nerve-wracking day.

## More Friend Than Photographer

A recurring theme in James's reviews is how quickly he transitions from service provider to trusted friend. One couple summed it up perfectly:

## Award-Winning Expertise

James is a multi-award-winning photographer specialising in reportage-style wedding photography. His approach focuses on capturing genuine moments – the smiles, the happy tears, the epic dance moves – without the stiff, posed shots that make wedding albums feel dated.

Based in Havant, he covers weddings across Hampshire and throughout the UK, with particular expertise in making camera-shy couples feel completely at ease.
