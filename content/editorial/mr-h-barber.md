## What Customers Say

**Steph lees** left a 5-star review:

> "Went here today (on a Sunday) with my 2 boys ages 2 and 5. They loved the rocket ship chair, the lolly and the their new hair, my 2 yr old wasn’t sure at first but the guy was so patient and kind. No clippers all scissors and a great job."

**S Goodman** left a 5-star review:

> "My partner went in here on the off chance as his regular barber was away. So pleased he did best haircut he’s ever had! Took there time he said he’s never felt so pampered. Highly recommended he’ll definitely be back 👍🏻"

**Kelly H** left a 5-star review:

> "We went to Slough to go to our usual - Gino' Bambinos - only to find that they had closed down. I decided to try Mr H Barbers instead, and I am so pleased that I did. My son is 20 months old and absolutely hates having his hair cut. The guy who looked after us was excellent with him and so gentle. I am so pleased with the cut, too. It's the best one he's ever had. I was very happy to pay £12 for this service. Thank you. We will be back very soon."
