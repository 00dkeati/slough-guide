Some things can only be learned through experience.

You can read every book on driving instruction. You can take every course. You can watch every video. But nothing replaces sitting next to thousands of learners, making thousands of corrections, and guiding people through thousands of tests.

Stuart at Havant Driving School has been doing exactly that for over 25 years.

## What 25 Years Teaches You

After a quarter century behind the dual controls, Stuart knows things that newer instructors simply can't:

- Which mistakes learners make most often — and how to prevent them
- The exact points on local test routes where people tend to fail
- How to read a student's body language and adapt on the fly
- The difference between someone who's nervous and someone who's not ready
- How to build confidence without giving false hope

This isn't textbook knowledge. It's wisdom earned through decades of practice.

## Client-Centred Learning

Stuart uses a "tailored blend of coaching and client-centred learning." In plain English: he adapts to you.

Some people learn by doing. Others need explanations. Some want to take it slow; others want to push ahead. Stuart's approach isn't one-size-fits-all — it's customised to how you learn best.

## Confidence Building

"Our aim is to build the confidence of each learner driver in many different driving situations."

That's the key phrase. Not just passing the test — building genuine confidence. The kind of confidence that means you're safe on the roads long after you've torn up your L-plates.

## Flexible Options

Whether you want weekly lessons at your own pace or need to accelerate with a semi-intensive course, Havant Driving School can accommodate:

- **Weekly lessons** — the traditional approach, fitting around your schedule
- **Semi-intensive courses** — for those who want to learn faster (subject to a 2-hour assessment at standard rate)
