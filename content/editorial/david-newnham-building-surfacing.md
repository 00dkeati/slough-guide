Some builders do small jobs. Some do big jobs. Dave Newnham does the jobs that require actually thinking about what you're doing.

Based on Jubilee Road in Slough, David Newnham Building & Surfacing is a local, family-run firm covering groundworks, surfacing, building services, conversions, and extensions. Their 19 Google reviews paint a picture of a team that doesn't just complete projects—they solve problems.

## The Problem Solvers

Multiple reviews mention Dave spending considerable time understanding problems before proposing solutions. This isn't the 'rip it out and start again' approach that many builders default to.

## What They Do

The range is comprehensive: block or tarmac driveways, garden patios, structural foundations, home refurbishments, brickwork, carports, fire and flood renovation, house cladding, general building, roofing, property extensions, conservatories, garage conversions, and loft conversions.

- **Driveways:** Block paving, tarmac, full removals and replacements
- **Groundworks:** Foundations, drainage, flood protection
- **Extensions:** Kitchen extensions, property additions
- **Roofing:** Re-roofing, flat-to-pitched conversions, cladding
- **Conversions:** Garage, loft, internal restructuring
- **Landscaping:** Patios, fencing, garden transformations

## The Reviews Tell the Story

## Repeat Customers

One reviewer mentions using Dave across 'both domestic and commercial projects' over years. Another has had four separate projects completed. A third calls them back repeatedly for 'big and small' jobs.

In the building trade, repeat business is the ultimate endorsement. It means the first job was good enough to risk a second.
