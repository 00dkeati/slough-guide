When Alain Sign offers to push you through a HIIT session, he's drawing on something most personal trainers can't: two decades competing as part of the British Olympic sailing team.

That background could make him intimidating. It doesn't.

## Olympic Expertise, Zero Attitude

There's a certain type of elite athlete who can't relate to normal people. Alain isn't one of them.

His approach is welcoming and non-intimidating. Whether you're training for a competition or just trying to lose a few pounds, he meets you where you are.
