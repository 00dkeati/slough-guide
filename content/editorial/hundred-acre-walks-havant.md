The woman behind Hundred Acre Walks gets it.

She's mum to two high-energy pups — a Samoyed and a Labradoodle who "keep her on her toes." Three cats who sleep most of the day "unless they want a fuss made of them." And a Dutch rabbit who's "getting on a bit now but still acts like a kit."

In other words: she knows what it's like to have pets who are family. And she knows how hard it is to leave them with someone else.

## More Than Dog Walking

Hundred Acre Walks isn't just about walking dogs. The service expands to cover whatever your pets need:

- **Dog Walking:** 30-minute to 1-hour sessions, one-on-one or group walks
- **Drop-in Service:** Multiple daily visits to keep pets occupied while you're out
- **Holiday Care:** Your small furry friends can stay while you're away
- **Pet Taxi:** Can't make that vet or grooming appointment? They'll take your pet for you
- **Small Animal Boarding:** Professional care for smaller pets

## The Pet Taxi

This is clever. Busy lives mean vet appointments and grooming sessions often fall at inconvenient times. Hundred Acre Walks can collect your pet, take them to their appointment, and bring them back.

One less thing to stress about.

## Cared For Like Their Own

"A professional service caring for your pets as if they were our own."

That's not marketing speak. When someone has a house full of their own beloved animals, they understand what your pets mean to you. They're not just doing a job — they genuinely love animals.
