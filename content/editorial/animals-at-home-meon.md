For many pet owners, the biggest stress of going away isn't the trip itself — it's worrying about who's looking after the animals. Kennels and catteries work, but they're not home.

Animals at Home Meon offers an alternative: professional pet care in familiar surroundings, where pets stay comfortable and owners stay reassured.

## Home Is Where the Heart Is

Pets, especially older ones or those with anxiety, can struggle in unfamiliar environments. The disruption of routine, strange smells, other animals — it adds stress to an already confusing situation.

Home-based pet care keeps everything familiar. Same bed, same garden, same feeding spot. The owner is away, but life continues largely as normal.

## More Than Just Feeding

Good pet care goes beyond the basics. It's about company, exercise, monitoring health, and providing the kind of attention that keeps animals genuinely happy rather than just surviving.

Animals at Home brings a professional approach to home pet care — proper routines, regular updates for owners, and the experience to spot when something isn't right.

## Flexible Options

Different pets need different care levels. Some need daily visits, others need live-in attention. Puppies require more than senior dogs. Cats have different needs than small animals.

The service adapts to what each pet actually requires, rather than forcing every situation into the same package.

## Peace of Mind Travels

Knowing your pets are properly cared for changes how you travel. No constant checking of phones, no guilt about leaving them behind, no worrying about what you'll find when you return.

Animals at Home Meon provides this peace of mind for Slough pet owners, backed by professional standards and genuine animal care experience.
