There's a roofing contractor in Portsmouth PO3 5DG whose phone actually rings when you call it. Where quotes arrive the same week. Where the work gets done without turning into a six-month saga involving mysterious delays and vanishing tradespeople.

It's called D C Roofing & Sons LTD, and 122 Google reviewers have left 5 stars' worth of opinions about them. That's not a few mates doing favours. That's a proper track record.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

**Reviews:** 122  
**Phone:** 07818 552450 (yes, it's a mobile — they actually answer)  
**Location:** 61 Locarno Rd, Portsmouth PO3 5DG

When you've got 122 reviews on Google, patterns emerge. And the pattern here is: people call D, D shows up, D fixes the roof, people write nice things online.

D C Roofing & Sons LTD has 122 reviews because they keep showing up. The work gets done. The phone gets answered. That's not revolutionary — it's just rare.
