Pilates looks simple. Roll out a mat, do some exercises, feel better. But doing it properly – with correct alignment, appropriate modifications, and technique that won't cause injury – that's where a good teacher makes all the difference.

Holly runs Pilates with Holly from her studio in Cowplain, and her 15 Google reviews paint a consistent picture: a teacher who actually teaches, explains properly, and makes corrections that matter.

## Technique That Sticks

The most common praise in Holly's reviews? She explains things properly. Not just "do this move" but why, how, and what to watch for.

That focus on proper form means beginners aren't left fumbling, and experienced practitioners keep improving.

## Small Classes, Personal Attention

Unlike packed gym classes where you're just another body on a mat, Holly keeps her sessions intimate. That means she can actually see what you're doing and help you do it better.

## Why Pilates Works

Whether you're dealing with back pain, recovering from injury, wanting to improve flexibility, or just looking for exercise that's challenging without being brutal – Pilates delivers. When it's taught properly.
