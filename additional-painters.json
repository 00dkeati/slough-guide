I was really impressed with the follow up after and the resources she put together.

        "text": "Jade transformed our tricky, dark, under-the-roof shower room into a beautiful, light and airy family bathroom that feels like a hotel! I had a few ideas of what I wanted but Jade really knew how to pull it all together into a modern design that also fits with the rest of the house decor. I knew her design would be beautiful as I had already seen pictures of her previous work, and we were blown away by the 3D computer rendering, which really helped us to imagine the space. Once completed, it was even better than I imagined! Somehow she managed to add a bathtub to our existing setup and yet the whole space feels even larger than before - the hallmark of a great designer! She was also able to advise and adapt when our builders needed a workaround, so that we were able to keep the design as true to the original as possible. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jade: she's professional, problem-solving, practically minded and a very talented designer. We hope to work with her again on future projects.",
