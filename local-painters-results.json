I would not hesitate to use their services again and I would strongly recommend them.\n\nI contacted them on 18.09.25.  They visited on 19.09.25 and produced a quote by 21.09.25 for full external repainting of lots of complex timber windows, a timber conservatory, iron gutters soffits and downpipes, main front and back doors and a large timber garage front doors and side door too.\n\nThey started work on 29.09.25 and completed the work by 20.10.25.  This is not an easy time of year to be painting external timber but they have produced a marvellous job sanding and filling some broken and soggy timbers.  They have really brought the outside of our house back to life and it is only just over a month since first contacting them!\n\nFred has been so polite and understanding and interested in the work and doing a good job.  His team is a credit to their profession.",

He went through the paint options, helped us select colours, and advised on the finish. He was super flexible when the build experienced inevitable delays; this is much appreciated and caused him no end of headaches! We’re delighted with the result and would like to thank the team for their efforts. We had a few complexities on timings and other elements as mentioned, but Matt addressed these to ensure the outcome was achieved without compromise.",

The cupboard doors were removed and taken away to their studio to be  stripped and spray painted. This gave them a finish to make them look brand new and the carcasses were painted to the same standard. The worktops were sanded, the ceiling and walls were prepped and painted, so the end result is very impressive. On top of all that they are thoroughly nice guys to work with and we will certainly employ them again in the future! The team is led by David, who is fanatical about attention to detail, materials, and tools which I guess comes from his degree in architectural modelling. 🤩",

Steve was equally amazing — his attention to detail was unlike anything I’ve ever seen, and he made sure everything was perfect.\n\nA huge thank you also to Tony, Paul, and Sam for their input and support along the way — it really was a team effort.
